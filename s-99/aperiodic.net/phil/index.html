  </div>
</div>

<p>I recently started a new job and my new manager wanted me to give him a
periodically-updated task list showing what I was working on, its
progress, and any deadlines I had.  I like Emacs' <a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a>, so
I set out to set up something in Org Mode that worked for both of us.
This is my story.</p>

<p>In general, I want to have a main directory for my files and, within that
directory, use a separate file for each distinct project I work on.  My
manager wanted to easily see project progress via milestones, so each
level-1 heading represents a milestone, while the deeper headings are more
fluid and are more for my benefit than his.  It was pretty easy to set up
HTML publishing from the Org file directory to a web server, so my manager
could browse through the details of my org files.</p>

<p>My manager also, however, wanted to see an overview page with sections for
current, future, and recently-past projects, with detail lines for the
milestones on current projects.  That proved to be the trickiest thing to
implement:  since I dislike repeating myself, I wanted as much of the
"current project status" part of the overview to be automatically
generated from the individual project files, including any milestone
deadlines but ignoring all of the more minor details.</p>

<p>Org Mode is big, so I spent a while reading through the manual about
custom agenda views and such until I stumbled on the <code>C-c / d</code> key
sequence, which folds all the file's subheadings and displays any
deadlines on the level-1 headings.  In combination with <code>C-c C-e v Spc</code>,
which exports only the visible portions of the current buffer to a new
org-mode buffer, I was able to create an org-mode formatted project
overview.  Thus, my general overview page (named index.org so it becomes
index.html during publishing) looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>* Active Projects

** [[file:project-1.org][Project 1 Description]]
   DEADLINE: &lt;2012-11-16 Fri&gt;
#+INCLUDE: "project-1.org_overview" :minlevel 2

** [[file:project-2.org][Project 2 Description]]
   DEADLINE: &lt;2012-11-30 Fri&gt;
#+INCLUDE: "project-2.org_overview" :minlevel 2

* Future Projects

** [[file:project-a.org][Project A Description]]
** [[file:project-b.org][Project B Description]]

* Recently Completed Projects

** [2012-11-01] [[file:project-x.org][Project X Description]]
</code></pre>

<p>I added a few CSS tweaks at the top of the index.org file to better fit
its purpose.  Mostly, they just put related things closer together and
deemphasize some of the extra information on the page:</p>

<pre><code>#+OPTIONS:   H:2 num:nil toc:nil tasks:t
#+STYLE: &lt;style&gt;
#+STYLE: .outline-3 h3 {
#+STYLE:   margin-bottom: 0;
#+STYLE: }
#+STYLE: .outline-text-3 p {
#+STYLE:   margin: 0;
#+STYLE: }
#+STYLE: .outline-4 {
#+STYLE:   line-height: 0.5em;
#+STYLE: }
#+STYLE: .outline-text-4 {
#+STYLE:   font-size: 0.75em;
#+STYLE: }
#+STYLE: .outline-4 h4 {
#+STYLE:   margin-bottom: 0;
#+STYLE: }
#+STYLE: &lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I also wrote the following two elisp functions.  The first one generates
the overview file for a given buffer, while the second looks through a
buffer for included overview files and regenerates all of them.</p>

<pre><code>(defun org-export-overview (file)
  (save-window-excursion
    (find-file file)
    (org-check-deadlines org-deadline-warning-days)
    (org-export-visible ?\  0) ; calls switch-to-buffer-other-window
    (write-file (concat file "_overview"))
    (kill-buffer)))

(defun org-export-overviews-for (buffer-or-name)
  (let ((plan-dir (file-name-directory (buffer-file-name (get-buffer buffer-or-name)))))
    (with-current-buffer buffer-or-name
      (save-excursion
        (goto-char 1)
        (while (re-search-forward "^#\\+INCLUDE: +\"\\(.*\\)_overview\"" nil t)
          (org-export-overview (concat plan-dir (match-string 1))))))))
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, I wrote a simple function that goes through all the stuff I need
to publish my org files and I call that hourly, so my manager can see my
current project status at pretty much any time with no manual steps on my
part:</p>

<pre><code>(defun pmg-org-publish ()
  (org-save-all-org-buffers)
  (org-export-overviews-for "index.org")
  (org-publish-all))

(run-at-time "00:45" 3600 'pmg-org-publish)
</code></pre>

<p>All I need to do is periodically update index.org as I add or complete
projects, and the rest of my work is done, as it normally is, in the
project files.  Thanks, Org Mode!</p>

<p>A question that perturbed me when I lived in Owings Mills was why there
were so many roads named "Dolfield".  There are three different Dolfield
Roads, one South Dolfield Road, and three Dolfield Boulevards.  I finally
got around to researching the question, and now I share the answer (to the
degreee that I have one) with everyone.</p>

<p>This is a map of Dolfield Road, past and present:</p>

<script>init_dolfield_rd();</script>

<p>The thick, dark blue line is where Dolfield Road once ran.  At one point,
it connected Painters Mill Road and Deer Park Road.</p>

<p>The thinner, light blue line shows where Dolfield Road, in all its
parts, runs today.  When Interstate 795 was built, Dolfield Road was cut
in two, as happened to many roads during the construation of the
Interstate system.  At the same time, part of the eastern portion of
Dolfield Road was diverted to make room for the ramps from Owings Mills
Boulevard to Interstate 795.  The section of Dolfield Road south of Owings
Mills Boulevard was renamed South Dolfield Road, for reasons I cannot
find.</p>

<p>At some point--I cannot tell when, exactly--the chunk of Dolfield Road
that extends from present-day Red Run Boulevard to Pleasant Hill Road was
closed, though I was unable to find out why.  The small section between
Red Run Boulevard and Interstate 795 now serves as an access road to a SHA
facility, and the rest of the closed section has been turned into a
hiking/biking trail (colored in light green on the map).  Finally, the
section of Dolfield Road just west of Pleasant Hill Road was realigned
when Dolfield Boulevard was built.</p>

<p>Here's a map of Dolfield Boulevard:</p>

<p>At some point in the past, the county planned to build a road named
Dolfield Boulevard that would connect Owings Mills New Town with the
eastern area of Reisterstown, both areas that were slated for new
development.  The road was planned to have two lanes in each direction
with a raised median dividing the road.  The dark purple line on the above
map shows where it was to have gone, as far as I can tell.  I'm not sure
whether the original plans included anything further north, though it
might have made sense to connect it to Owings Mills Boulevard.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the county, a number of people living in the proposed
path of the new road put up sufficient objections that the project
stalled.  Portions along Reisterstown Road and Academy Avenue were built
and, in both cases, partly divided and partly not--the light purple
lines are the divided sections and the pink lines are the undivided
sections.  Furthermore, the southern end of Dolfield Boulevard was built
without incident as part of the development of Owings Mills New Town,
though part of Pleasant Hill Road was rechristened Dolfield Boulevard but
left undivided.</p>

<p>From what I can tell, the county never entirely abandoned its plans for
Dolfield Boulevard, but they seems to be shelved indefinitely.  Separately
from those plans, they are currently considering adding an interchange
between Dolfield Boulevard and Interstate 795 (which would have been
really convenient for me if it had been in place when I lived there).</p>

<p>So there are three sections of Dolfield Road (and a South Dolfield Road)
because Interstate 795 and other factors caused a former road to be split
into pieces, and there are three sections of Dolfield Boulevard because
that's as far as the county has gotten on the plans for a new road.  This
ends today's episode of "I'm a geek and will research anything that
catches my fancy".</p>

    <a href="archives/Geekery/knife-meme.html" title="permalink for Knife Meme" rel="bookmark">#</a>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This is <a href="https://vees.net/blog/68">a thing</a>, apparently: "Take knife from pocket, post
pic on the internet."</p>

<p><a style="float: right; clear: both" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/phil_g/6169449074/" title="Myerchin Lightknife by phil_g, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6172/6169449074_f1b6778427_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Myerchin Lightknife"></a>
My main knife, and the one that best matches the intent of the
meme, I think, is a <a href="http://www.myerchin.com/">Myerchin</a> Lightknife L377P, which they
apparently don't sell anymore.  It's a very nice, light, compact knife,
with a multipurpose half-straight half-serrated blade; a marlinspike,
which is useful for knot- and ropework; and a small red LED, which is nice
for seeing things without ruining your night vision.  I use the
marlinspike a lot less these days, because I don't do as much decorative
knotwork, but it's still occasionally useful.</p>

<p>The knife was a Christmas gift from my dad and stepmother a number of
years ago.  (Possibly 2004 or so.)  I'd been thinking about replacing my
at-the-time pocket knife, something from Spyderco, with a lighter, more
compact knife, when I read
<a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/000209.php">a Cool Tools review of the Myerchin L377P</a>.  It sounded
like it would do everything I wanted and more, so I made a Christmas
request and then got what I asked for.</p>

<p><a style="float: right; clear: both" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/phil_g/6169455480/" title="Brookstone Credit Card Multi-tool by phil_g, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6151/6169455480_345419841f_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Brookstone Credit Card Multi-tool"></a>
The Myerchin isn't the only knife that meets the letter of the meme's
wording, though.  I also have a credit-card-shaped multitool from
Brookstone in my wallet.  I use it mostly for its tweezers, but its pen,
needle, scissors, and knife blade are also occasionally useful.</p>

<p><a style="float: right; clear: both" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/phil_g/6168929255/" title="Victorinox CyberTool by phil_g, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6167/6168929255_7890927dc5_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Victorinox CyberTool"></a>
A knife I also usually have on me is my
<a href="http://www.swissarmy.com/MultiTools/Pages/Product.aspx?category=doityourself&amp;product=53919&amp;">Victorinox Swiss Army CyberTool</a>.  Technically, it lives in my
laptop bag, not my pocket, but I usually have the bag with me.  It's very
useful for dealing with all sorts of small-scale hardware, because it's
got the screwdriver with interchangeable phillips, flat, and torx bits,
plus the small pliers (which also include a wire cutter).</p>

<p>This was a birthday gift from my parents back in 2000 or so.  It replaced
my previous everyday knife, a
<a href="http://www.sakwiki.com/tiki-index.php?page=Automobile+Special">Swiss Army Automobile Special</a>, which had also been a
birthday gift from my parents.  Victorinox had just come out with the
CyberTool and I'd been working for a couple of years in a hardware and
software tech support position, so I let my parents know I was really
interested in the new knife.  More than ten years later, it's still
serving me well.</p>

<p><a style="float: right; clear: both" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/phil_g/6169486394/" title="CRKT Rollock by phil_g, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6156/6169486394_cedd113afd_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="CRKT Rollock"></a>
The last knife that I usually have on me (also in my laptop bag) is a
<a href="http://www.crkt.com/">Columbia River Knife &amp; Tool</a> Rollock, which doesn't appear to be
for sale anymore.  It's got an interesting opening mechanism; instead of
unfolding, the blade flips up a little and slides out of the body, locking
into place at its fullest extent.  It's mostly in my laptop bag because
it's very slim, so it doesn't take up much extra room and it's handy if
I've forgotten my Myerchin somewhere.  Because it's got a completely
straight blade, it's less of a pain to sharpen than the Myerchin, so it's
usually the sharpest knife I have on me, which sometimes means I use it
instead of the Myerchin even if I have both with me.</p>

<p>This one was a gift from my youngest sister at her wedding as thanks for
being a groomsman and playing trumpet in the wedding.</p>

</div>

<p>Just today I found about <a href="https://code.google.com/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.html#routes_txt___Field_Definitions">GTFS</a>, a standardized data format from Google
for describing public transit schedules.  I subsequently discovered that
<a href="http://mta.maryland.gov/about/publicgtfsdata.cfm">the MTA has a GTFS feed</a>.</p>

<p>Back when I didn't have a car, I used the MTA daily and had a set of
scripts to extract their schedule data from the website and import it into
<a href="http://trainsched.sourceforge.net/">trainsched</a> on my Palm Pilot.  I asked them for more structured data at
one point but was rebuffed, so I stuck with my scripts that had to be
updated every time they changed their schedule pages.</p>

<p>I don't have a Palm Pilot any more (and trainsched doesn't even run on the
PalmOS emulator on my WebOS phone), but I thought it would be nice to
update my old scripts to use the new GTFS feeds.  This should even work
with other GTFS feeds; there's nothing really MTA-specific going on.</p>

<p>I've been having intermittent problems with my car that have now stumped
two mechanics, so I'm turning to the Internet for advice.  I have a 1996
Jeep Grand Cherokee, with Selec-Track four-wheel-drive and a 6 cylinder
engine.</p>

<p>The problem I'm having is that the engine will sometimes just stall (the
motive power goes away and the engine RPMs drop to zero).  It only seems
to happen right after starting the car (so the engine hasn't warmed up
yet), and it's much more common in wet weather (rain, snow, heavy fog).
Often times, I can feel the engine losing power and can prevent a stall by
stepping on the gas pedal.  If the engine actually stalls, I have to wait
at least a minute to restart it; if I try restarting it immediately, I
hear the chug-chug-chug of the starter, but the engine won't start
running.</p>

<p>I've had a few times when the stalling seemed to hit as I was braking,
just as the automatic transmission was downshifting from second to first
gear.  I've had the car sall at times apparently unrelated to shifting,
though.</p>

<p>This morning, it was particularly bad.  I barely got out of the parking
lot at home (after several stop/wait/restart cycles) before the engine
stopped being useful--it would only run for 30-45 seconds before stalling,
and I couldn't prevent the stall.  I had the car towed to a mechanic, but
by the time they took a look at it, the engine started and ran normally.
They couldn't find anything wrong with the engine, and there were no codes
from the onboard diagnostics.</p>

<p>The coolant system has a slow leak (my regular mechanic tracked it to the
water pump, I think), but I've had that for over a year now and I doubt
it's related.  In the time since the problem first manifested, I've had a
system tune-up (including replacing the spark plug wiring, apparently a
common contributor to problems such as these), had the oil changed, had
the transmission fluid changed, and had a (presumably unrelated)
badly-leaking coolant hose replaced.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on what to look for to fix this will be gladly accepted.
I'll be cross-posting this to several social media sites; responses there
are fine, or just send an email to <a href="mailto:phil_g@pobox.com">phil_g@pobox.com</a></p>

<p><strong>Update 2010-01-02</strong>: I've gotten a number of suggestions for problem
areas that could be causing this problem.  The most-suggested item was the
fuel filter, which I haven't replaced since I got the car five years ago,
so I'm taking care of that to start with.  I'll see how well the car
behaves with a new filter.  Other suggestions have included the idle
valve, O2 sensor, or fuel pump.  If replacing the fuel filter doesn't
work, I'll check out some of the other possibilities.</p>

    <a href="archives/General/kiva.html" title="permalink for Kiva" rel="bookmark">#</a>
  </div>
</div>

<p>I've been contributing to <a href="http://www.kiva.org/">Kiva</a> for a number of months now, and am
sufficiently appreciative of them to want to tell others about them.  The
short version is that Kiva is a distributed, peer-to-peer microlending
non-profit with the goal of alleviating global poverty.</p>

<h4>Microlending</h4>

<p>Microfinance is the practice of providing financial services to people in
low-income parts of the world who are not generally considered
profitable-enough customers to warrant service from traditional banking
institutions.</p>

<p>Microlending (or microcredit) is a subset of microfinance that provides
loans to low-income people, typically entrepreneurs in low-income area of
the world, who do not have access to loans from traditional banking
sources.  Sometimes there simply are no banks in the area, but more
typically the entrepreneurs don't make enough money to qualify for loans,
don't have sufficient collateral, or don't have a sufficient credit
history.  Modern microlending started in the 1970s with the
Bangladesh-based Grameen Bank.</p>

<p>The advantages of microlending over traditional aid programs are in its
benefits to developing economies: it encourages growth of local
businesses, puts more money into local economies, encourages local
employment opportunities, and gives entrepreneurs a foothold to establish
their businesses and a credit record.  In some areas, it provides an
alternative to tribal moneylenders, who charge high interest rates and
respond to repayment failures with physical violence.  In short,
traditional aid addresses people's basic needs: food, shelter, clothing,
education, sustainable agriculture; while microlending works on the next
step of growing local economies.</p>

<h4>Kiva's contribution</h4>

<p>Kiva was created as the first distributed, peer-to-peer microlending
organization in the world.  It's peer-to-peer because all Kiva does is
list loan applicants on their website; it's up to the users of the website
to supply the money to fund the loans.  As the loans are repaid, those
repayments go to the people who supplied the money.  Kiva is distributed
because the funding for any given loan is made up of contributions from
many different Kiva users.  (And as the loan is repaid, each contributor
is repaid according to his or her portion of the overall loan.)</p>

<p>The actual process is a little more involved.  Kiva doesn't make loans
directly.  Instead, they partner with microfinance institutions (MFIs) in
other countries.  The MFIs accept loan applications, evaluate the
applicants, disburse loans, and collect payments.  During this process,
the MFIs tell Kiva about the loans in batches, Kiva lists the loans,
collects the contributions from Kiva users, and sends the money to the
MFIs.  When the MFIs collect money, they send the payments (again, in
batches) to Kiva, which distributes the payments to the loan contributors.
The MFIs often fund the loans before telling Kiva about them (to avoid the
delays in the funding process and get the money to the applicant quickly),
and then backfill the accounting once the loan is actually funded.  In
some cases, a loan will expire on Kiva without being fully funded; when
that happens, any contributors will have their contributions refunded, and
if the MFI already disbursed the loan, they will have to find another
source of funding for it.</p>

<h4>Loan repayment</h4>

<p>When payments are received on a loan, the money is made available to
contributors as "Kiva Credits".  If you have Kiva credits, you can apply
them to a different loan, donate them to Kiva itself, or transfer them
into a PayPal account.</p>

<h4>Defaults</h4>

<p>Because most loans are made in developing areas of the world, if someone
defaults on their loan, there is often no workable legal recourse for
requiring repayment and the people who contributed to the loan are not
repaid.  The MFIs do research on the applicants before granting loans, and
do a generally good job of selecting people who will repay their loans.
Kiva has an overall default rate of about 2%.  (For comparison, in 2004,
the federal Small Business Administration, which makes loans to small
businesses in the US, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2009/02/25/smallbusiness/smallbiz_loan_defaults_soar.smb/">had a 2.4% default rate</a>, which has
hit 11.9% with the recession.)</p>

<p>This does mean that any loan made through Kiva carries the risk of losing
the money contributed.</p>

<h4>Interest</h4>

<p>Kiva does not collect any interest on its loans.  Consequently, Kiva users
will only get back exactly what they put into the loan in the first place,
unless the loan defaults.  This means that anyone contributing to Kiva
loans over a long term can expect to lose some money to defaults.  Because
Kiva is operated as a non-profit organization with the goal of alleviating
poverty, they don't feel it is appropriate to add interest payments to the
loans they fund.</p>

<p>The MFIs that Kiva partners with do charge interest, however.  The
interest that they charge pays for their staff and administration costs.
Typically, they charge a small percentage of the loan in interest, plus a
flat fee to cover the effort necessary for any loan, regardless of its
size.  This includes things like interviewing applicants and researching
their financial history and dependability.  Because the loan amounts are
small, that fee often adds a noticeable percentage to the loan, leading to
interest rates that seem surprisingly high.  The average interest rate on
Kiva is about 35%, but I've seen rates as high as 50%.</p>

<p>The MFI interest rates are another reason that Kiva doesn't charge
interest themselves; they don't want to add any more to the borrower's
repayment load.</p>

<p>For each of its partners, Kiva shows both the average interest rate for
that MFI and the median interest rate for other MFIs in the same region.
People worried about the high rates are encouraged to check up on the MFI
before committing to a loan.</p>

<h4>Kiva's Funding</h4>

<p>Since Kiva doesn't collect interest and they apply all of a contributor's
money to the loans themselves, they rely on donations to keep running.
After you contribute to a loan, they ask for a donation and suggest an
amount equal to 15% of your loan contribution.  You have the option of
choosing a different percentage (including 0%) or specifying a particular
dollar amount.  You can also give the repayments on your loans to Kiva as
a donation, either manually (by donating your Kiva credits) or
automatically (by specifying that all repayments should be automatically
donated).</p>

<p>Kiva is a 501(c)3 nonprofit, so all donations are tax-deductible, although
loans are not.  (As mentioned above, loans are not even guaranteed to
maintain value.)</p>

<h4>Criticism</h4>

<p>I feel it would be unfair to talk about Kiva without acknowledging that
some people have criticisms of the microlending process.</p>

<p>The most common criticism about microlending in general is the high
interest rates.  Kiva does as well as it can in this area, recognizing
that MFIs need to charge enough to fund their activities, but also being
as transparent as possible about what is being charged.  Kiva also
periodically reviews their partners' claims and practices.  (They have
<a href="http://www.kiva.org/about/aboutPartner?id=53">closed relations with at least one partner</a> because of fraud--not
interest related, in this case; the partner was claiming much higher
amounts on its loans than it was actually disbursing.)</p>

<p>Conversely, some people argue that Kiva should themselves be charging
interest.  I can't find the article now, but I read a piece a while back
that argued that when microfinance funding organizations like Kiva pay
interest, contributors change from a "charity" mindset to an "investment"
mindset and end up putting more money into system.  Personally, I think
that the charity mindset is a better fit here.  If the goal is to
alleviate poverty, then helping people establish businesses with as few
impediments (including additional interest) as possible is a better
approach than one that is beholden to the best return on investments.</p>

<p>There are also claims that microlending doesn't help all that much.  There
was an article in the Boston Globe a few months ago titled "<a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/09/20/small_change_does_microlending_actually_fight_poverty?mode=PF">Small
change</a>: Billions of dollars and a Nobel Prize
later, it looks like ‘microlending’ doesn’t actually do much to fight
poverty".  Despite the inflammatory subtitle, the article is reasonably
balanced.  It refers to two unpublished papers about studies that
concluded that microlending is not as effective as many people think.  For
one thing, I'd want to wait until the papers are published; peer review is
likely to shake out any methodological problems in the studies.  But the
article points out that the studies found that microlending did make a
difference for a lot of businesses and helped them either establish
themselves or grow.  It's not a panacea--if for no other reason than that
the eligibility requirements for "who can take out a loan and be counted
on to repay it if there's little government enforcement to rely on" mean
that only a small part of the population will be considered in the first
place--but it is a step in the direction of helping establish functioning
local economies in poor regions.  The article provides a number of
pro-microfinance perspectives, most of which boil down to, "The studies
show that microlending isn't magic, but it's a useful tool--as long as you
understand that it isn't magic."</p>

<p>Kiva in particular was the target of some criticism recently when they
began offering loans to entrepreneurs in the US.  Many people felt that
people in the US are either well-served by the standard banking system or
have access to many government programs and would not get much additional
benefit from a microloan.  I tend to regard this as a place where it's
best to give people the ability to make their own decisions.  Kiva felt
that there was benefit to offering loans in the US, and those who agree
with them can now participate in those loans.  Those who disagree have no
obligation to fund US loans, and there are plenty of available loans in
poorer countries.  (There was a time when Kiva funded every loan it
offered and sometimes ran out of new loans to fund.  These days, there's
more demand, and loans do periodically expire unfunded.)</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>I think that Kiva provides an important service to developing areas of the
world, and I put a portion of my charitable giving into the site each
month.  Personally, I don't plan to take money out of it; what I put in
goes either towards funding more loans or donations to keep Kiva running.
Other people have different financial approaches, of course.</p>

<p>Kiva also isn't the only place I donate.  In addition to local giving, I
also contribute to more traditional aid organizations, because
microlending is only effective if people are already healthy, educated,
and empowered.  For giving along more traditional lines, I recommend
<a href="http://www.heifer.org/">Heifer International</a>, which mostly focuses on
sustainable agriculture in developing regions.</p>

<h4>Competition</h4>

<p>Kiva was the first peer-to-peer microlending website, but many others have
followed in its footsteps, and some of its competitors take different
approaches to microlending.  If you don't like Kiva, there might be
another organization that's a better fit for you.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.microfinancegateway.org/p/site/m/">The Microfinance Gateway</a> is a large database of
microfinance organizations, including aggregators like Kiva.  It
contains links to many more organizations than I'm going to link to
here.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.unitedprosperity.org/">United Prosperity</a> doesn't directly give
contributed money to borrowers; it uses that money as collateral for
traditional bank loans.  They feel that this approach is better at
integrating people into the traditional banking system.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rotarianmicrocredit.org/">The Rotarian Action Group for Microcredit</a> works to assist
Rotary groups with setting up their own microlending operations.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.microplace.com/">MicroPlace</a> collects interest on its microloans, so
contributors earn a return on their contributions.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.prosper.com/">Prosper</a> is a more general peer-to-peer lending broker.
Contributors can use it either as a general investment fund or a broker
for choosing individual loans to fund.  Anyone with a decent credit
score can request a loan, which is bid on by lenders.</li>
</ul>

<h4>My Kiva History</h4>

<p>If you want, you can look at <a href="http://www.kiva.org/lender/asciiphil">my lender page</a> on Kiva.  So
far, I've contributed to 11 loans:</p>

<ul>

notes that government regulations on foreign loans are murky and they
might not be able to receive the money from the borrower's payments.  I
figured it was good to support a business in Iraq, though, so I
accepted the risk.)</li>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Betsy McCaughy has written an opinion piece for bloomberg.com titled <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601039&amp;sid=aLzfDxfbwhzs">Ruin
Your Health With the Obama Stimulus Plan</a>.  In it, she
characterizes the stimulus package (as passed by the House) as containing
sinister language that will allow the government to control and reduce the
quality of health care available to the American public.  I took a look at
the sections of the bill that she has issues with, and I found that her
conclusions are gross distortions at best.  More or less everything she
points to in the bill is focused on providing a healthcare information
technology infrastructure to allow doctors and hospitals easy access to
patients' complete medical information--nothing more.</p>

<p>(Since I wrote my analysis, the people at <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/">FactCheck.org</a> have
done <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/politics/doctors_orders.html" title="FactCheck.org: Doctor's Orders?">their own analysis</a>, which is more in depth than
mine.  The conclusions are similar--McCaughey is misunderstanding a lot of
the bill--although they allow that some parts of the bill don't
necessarily forbid her worst-case scenario.  (They also note that much of
what she worries about has been in place already, under a program created
by George W Bush: the bill just turns an executive order into established
law.))</p>

<p>She also makes a lot of comparisons to Tom Daschle's book
<a href="http://isbn.nu/0312383010" class="booktitle">Critical: What We Can Do About the Health-Care
Crisis</a>, drawing sinister inferences from the comparisons.  I
haven't read the book, so I can't judge how right or wrong she is about
its contents, but the contents of the actual bill are not what she says
they are.</p>

<p>To begin with, she claims that the government will be overseeing what your
doctor does and dictating treatments:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One new bureaucracy, the National Coordinator of Health Information
  Technology, will monitor treatments to make sure your doctor is doing
  what the federal government deems appropriate and cost effective. The
  goal is to reduce costs and “guide” your doctor’s decisions (442, 446).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The actual text of the bill is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>                           page 441
19      “(b) PURPOSE.--The National Coordinator shall per-
20 form the duties under subsection (c) in a manner con-
21 sistent with the development of a nationwide health infor-
22 mation technology infrastructure that allows for the elec-
23 tronic use and exchange of information and that--

                           page 442
 1            “(1) ensures that each patient's health informa-
 2      tion is secure and protected, in accordance with ap-
 3      plicable law;
 4            “(2) improves health care quality, reduces med-
 5      ical errors, reduces health disparities, and advances
 6      the delivery of patient-centered medical care;
 7            “(3) reduces health care costs resulting from
 8      inefficiency, medical errors, inappropriate care, du-
 9      plicative care, and incomplete information;
10            “(4) provides appropriate information to help
11      guide medical decisions at the time and place of
12      care;
13            “(5) ensures the inclusion of meaningful public
14      input in such development of such infrastructure;
15            “(6) improves the coordination of care and in-
16      formation among hospitals, laboratories, physician
17      offices, and other entities through an effective infra-
18      structure for the secure and authorized exchange of
19      health care information;
20            “(7) improves public health activities and facili-
21      tates the early identification and rapid response to
22      public health threats and emergencies, including bio-
23      terror events and infectious disease outbreaks;
24            “(8) facilitates health and clinical research and
25      health care quality;

                           page 443
 1            “(9) promotes prevention of chronic diseases;
 2            “(10) promotes a more effective marketplace,
 3      greater competition, greater systems analysis, in-
 4      creased consumer choice, and improved outcomes in
 5      health care services; and
 6            “(11) improves efforts to reduce health dispari-
 7      ties.
</code></pre>

<p>The whole thing is talking about making patients' medical information
available by electronic means to hospitals, doctors, and insurance
companies while maintaing the patients' privacy.  Clause (4), in
particular, refers to doctors being able to have all of the information
they need when making decisions.  It does not imply anything about the
government dictating doctors' decisions to them.</p>

<p>She goes on to talk about hospitals and doctors not being "meaningful
users" of the system, and she seems to imply that this will result in
doctors abandoning treatments that aren't government-sanctioned:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hospitals and doctors that are not “meaningful users” of the new system
  will face penalties.  “Meaningful user” isn’t defined in the
  bill. ... What penalties will deter your doctor from going beyond the
  electronically delivered protocols when your condition is atypical or
  you need an experimental treatment?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here's what the bill has to say about "meaningful users":</p>

<pre><code>                           page 511

 7           “(A) IN    GENERAL.--For purposes of para-
 8     graph (1), an eligible hospital shall be treated
 9     as a meaningful EHR user for a reporting pe-
10     riod for a payment year (or, for purposes of
11     subsection (b)(3)(B)(ix), for a reporting period
12     under such subsection for a fiscal year) if each
13     of the following requirements are met:
14                 “(i) MEANINGFUL  USE OF CERTIFIED
15           EHR TECHNOLOGY.--The       eligible hospital
16           demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Sec-
17           retary, in accordance with subparagraph
18           (C)(i), that during such period the hospital
19           is using certified EHR technology in a
20           meaningful manner.
21                 “(ii) INFORMATION  EXCHANGE.--The
22           eligible hospital demonstrates to the satis-
23           faction of the Secretary, in accordance
24           with subparagraph (C)(i), that during such
25           period such certified EHR technology is

                           page 541
 1           connected in a manner that provides, in
 2           accordance with law and standards appli-
 3           cable to the exchange of information, for
 4           the electronic exchange of health informa-
 5           tion to improve the quality of health care,
 6           such as promoting care coordination.
 7                 “(iii) REPORTING     ON   MEASURES
 8           USING      EHR.--Subject  to subparagraph
 9           (B)(ii) and using such certified EHR tech-
10           nology, the eligible hospital submits infor-
11           mation for such period, in a form and
12           manner specified by the Secretary, on such
13           clinical quality measures and such other
14           measures as selected by the Secretary
15           under subparagraph (B)(i).

<p>"Meaningful EHR users" will be given financial incentives to use the
electronic system.  If a doctor or hospital is not a "meaningful EHR
user", that means only that they're not making use of the electronic
medical information infrastructure.  It has nothing to do with what
treatments they offer.  Furthermore, non-"meaningful users" don't face
penalties; they just don't have the government helping them pay for the
upfront cost of implementing the electronic system.</p>

<p>Next, she claims that the bill creates a department to prevent people from
using new medical treatments because they're more expensive:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In his book, Daschle proposed an appointed body with vast powers to make
  the “tough” decisions elected politicians won’t make.  The stimulus bill
  does that, and calls it the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative
  Effectiveness Research (190-192).  The goal, Daschle’s book explained, is
  to slow the development and use of new medications and technologies
  because they are driving up costs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, the bill:</p>

<pre><code>                           page 190
 7 SEC. 9201. FEDERAL COORDINATING COUNCIL FOR COM-
 8                 PARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH.
 9        (a) ESTABLISHMENT.--There is hereby established a
10 Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effective-
11 ness Research (in this section referred to as the “Coun-
12 cil”).
13        (b) PURPOSE; DUTIES.--The Council shall--
14             (1) assist the offices and agencies of the Fed-
15        eral Government, including the Departments of
16        Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs, and
17        Defense, and other Federal departments or agencies,
18        to coordinate the conduct or support of comparative
19        effectiveness and related health services research;
20        and
21             (2) advise the President and Congress on--
22                  (A) strategies with respect to the infra-
23             structure needs of comparative effectiveness re-
24             search within the Federal Government;

                           page 191
 1                  (B) appropriate organizational expendi-
 2             tures for comparative effectiveness research by
 3             relevant Federal departments and agencies; and
 4                  (C) opportunities to assure optimum co-
 5             ordination of comparative effectiveness and re-
 6             lated health services research conducted or sup-
 7             ported by relevant Federal departments and
 8             agencies, with the goal of reducing duplicative
 9             efforts and encouraging coordinated and com-
10             plementary use of resources.
</code></pre>

<p>The supposedly sinister Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative
Effectiveness Research seems to be more like the Department of Homeland
Security for existing federal health care systems.  Programs like
Medicaid, veteran's benefits, and federal employee health insurance
already make estimations on the effectiveness of various treatments, just
like every private health insurance company.  The new council would
share information across the federal programs that already exist.</p>

<p>Following that, she claims that the bill would change the standards for
approved Medicare treatments, implying that fewer treatments will be
approved:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Medicare now pays for treatments deemed safe and effective. The stimulus
  bill would change that and apply a cost- effectiveness standard set by
  the Federal Council (464).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Page 464 contains references to implementing things specified under
section 3004, which describes the process for adopting and implementing
the previously-mentioned technology infrastructure.  I can find no mention
of Medicare.  It seems very much like this claim is completely fabricated.</p>

<p>Every complaint that the author raises, everything that she claims will
affect what care doctors are willing to give, seems to only concern the
healthcare information technology infrastructure that Obama has been
talking about implementing for months.  I see no places where the
government will be dictating <em>anything</em> to doctors, aside from providing
financial incentives (not punishments) to work with the new
infrastructure.  None of the author's claims about the government cutting
off healthcare seem at all founded in fact.  At best, she's consistently
misreading the text of the bill.  I think it more likely that she has
other reasons not to want the bill to pass and is distorting the reality
of the situation to steer people in the direction she wants them to go.</p>

<h1>Phil!'s Tutorial Outlines</h1>

<p>Over the years I've put together a few tutorials, mostly for the
<a href="http://lug.umbc.edu/">UMBC LUG</a>.  I've collected those here as
a reference.  Most of these were written for me to give the talk; they may
not have enough information for others to learn from on their own.  On the
other hand, they may be very useful.  Good luck.  :)</p>

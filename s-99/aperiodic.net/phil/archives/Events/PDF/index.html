<p>Yeah, I haven't even finished with my entry for Burning Man this year, but
this PDF entry should be a bit shorter, so my lazy butt is doing it first.</p>

<p>This PDF was a bit different from previous ones, both in general and for
me specifically.  A lot of the planning for it happened at close to the
last minute, but everything did manage to come together in time for the
event.  I also left my planning to the last minute, but I'm familiar
enough with my camping gear that I can toss everything together pretty
quickly.</p>

<p>I was only there from Saturday afternoon through Sunday afternoon; I
worked on Friday and Monday.  While I had arranged for a ride to PDF, I
hadn't found one back on Sunday, a situation I will not allow again.  It
was simply too stressful looking for a ride on Sunday afternoon with the
prospect of possibly having to call in to work and say I couldn't make it
in on Monday.</p>

<p>Aside from that, the weekend was beautiful.  This was a much more mellow
burn than even previous Fall burns.  At other times, I've had the feeling
of a very active burn--go and do stuff and experience things.  At this
one, people set up their camps and proceeded to just hang out.  I had a
moment late Sunday morning where I just looked around the site and was
nearly overwhelmed by how beautiful everything was.  I felt forced to lay
down and rest, for fear that I might explode with happiness.</p>

<p>I didn't really <em>do</em> a whole lot over the weekend.  I hung out at
the Gold Bar, a pastime I can easily recommend to others.  I rangered a
bit.  I hung out at Primal Phred.  I watched the main burn.  I hung out in
the pavilion.  I had a great weekend with my friends.</p>

<p>And I made Jill very happy by finally consenting to a body shot.  Yes,
Jill has drunk a mudslide from my navel.  She seems, oh, slightly pleased
about it.</p>

<p>I'm very happy to have gone, even if for but a scant twenty-four hours.</p>

  <h3>Post-PDF Dump</h3>
  <div class="title-links">

    <a href="../../Events(1)" >Events</a>/<a href="../PDF(1)" >PDF</a> |
    
    <a href="2003-spring-afterward.html" title="permalink for Post-PDF Dump" rel="bookmark">#</a>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Originally from an email sent to the baltwash-burning mailing list:</p>

<p>(Not that sort of dump, Dale.)  :)</p>

<p>I typed all of this up for my diary then figured I might as well send out
to the list (with some of the more personal bits removed--sorry).</p>

<ul>
<li>Who Needs Friendster? *</li>
</ul>

<p>As a result of being at PDF, I'm now very used to walking anywhere and
running into friends.  Now, of course, I expect this to extend into the
rest of the world, so I keep catching glimpses of people and I get all
hopeful for a moment or two.  "Is that Dale over there?"  "Hey, that looks
like Sean!"  "Red hair, hey it's Suz!  Oh, just a red hat."  Of course,
<em>at</em> PDF, I almost goose--er, said, "Hi, Rob" to several people in orange
hats.</p>

<ul>
<li>Miscellaneous Things I Liked *</li>
</ul>

<p>I love my tent.  I stayed nice and dry, at least when I was in it, and all
my gear remained dry and mud free, despite the location of the tent in a
river of mud.  (It's a Sierra Designs Clip Flashlight CD.  Only really
sleeps one person with gear, but it works quite well for just me.)</p>

<p>Rob's radio station rocked.  If I didn't like the current music, I could
just pop in the earphones and listen to something I liked, especially if
Rob or Dale was spinning at the time.</p>

<ul>
<li>Main Burn *</li>
</ul>

<p>The main burn was beautiful.  Declan got a great shot of it, too:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mccullagh.org/image/10d-3/the-burn-2.html">
    http://www.mccullagh.org/image/10d-3/the-burn-2.html
  </a></p>

<p>Once it was going well, I liked the view from the side, with the internal
red glow coming through the gaps between the still-unburnt logs on the
outside.  And the fire team did an excellent job just getting it lit in
the first place.</p>

<p>The wet ground was conducive to the "spin white gas onto the ground at
your feet then light it" effect, though I was successful in not emulating
Sean.  (i.e. I didn't set the fuel dump on fire.)</p>

<p>I like Alex's (dancingmantis) poi.  Three wicks, short, long life even
with white gas, and metal rings for handles to facilitate movement of the
poi.  Now I need to make a set of my own like that.  I think I'll work on
my planned single wick monkey fist poi first, though.</p>

<p>I did burn myself with Alex's poi, though.  (I wasn't quite familiar
enough with the handles to have attempted an over-the-head thread the
needle.)  It's probably the worst burn I've had from poi (some blistering,
which mostly subsided by morning) and also the most fun I've had burning
myself.  :)</p>

<p>Helping quadgirl lose her fire virginity was fun.  And she looked good
with the staff, too.</p>

<p>There was one particular woman spinning that had a very beautiful spinning
style.  I didn't get to talk to her afterwards and see who she was,
though.  (Too much other stuff going on.)</p>

<ul>
<li>Dress Day *</li>
</ul>

<p>Many thanks to Tanya for lending me her pink wig, pink lipstick, and
glitter on Saturday.  They all went well with my pink dress and pink
umbrella.</p>

  </a></p>

<ul>
<li>Iron Chef *</li>
</ul>

<p>Once again, PDF Iron Chef was a blast.  Many thanks to Leah for running it
a second time.  This time around it was vegans versus carnivores, with a
theme ingredient of tofu.  The vegans managed to win over the judges (even
though the carnivores had sushi with eel; I mean, eel sushi, c'mon :) ).
I wish I'd been able to taste more of the dishes.  (In particular the
vegans' oatmeal-fruit-tofu pie looked very good.)  I was busy making sure
things were coordinated (or micromanaging, depending on how you look at
it) and by the time I got to taste the food, most of it had been eaten.
But the vegans added more tofu to their curry, Magorn had a lot of chicken
dish and sauce, and Suz saved me a piece of sushi.  So I had some things,
which was an improvement over last year.</p>

<ul>
<li>Theme Camps *</li>
</ul>

<p>The Gold Bar was again fun.  I like just hanging out there, talking to
Whiskey and company, and chatting with people as they drop by.  It's too
bad they were down a couple of people (having a baby right before PDF, how
silly :) ) and that they packed up early and left on Saturday.</p>

<p>I was also sad to see Dale and Sara leaving Saturday evening.  And while
I'm missing people, I was disappointed not to see Alicia or Laura there.
Silly people, moving away from Baltimore.  :)</p>

<p>Primal Fred was fun, though a bit distant.  Jill's body shot bar looked
fun for those participating.  Not really my thing, though.  I'm too
private a person (and too shy) to do body shots in public.</p>

<p>I think I'll camp in the general camping area next PDF.  While I liked the
theme camps, it's a good hike to get out there.  And they can be loud
(especially the DJ who set up across the way from Psychedelic Shamans; I
probably should have tried to talk to him, but I was far too tired, even
if I couldn't actually sleep very well through the loudness).  I also like
hanging out in the pavilion, which is really the hub of PDF.</p>

<ul>
<li>Everything Else *</li>
</ul>

<p>There were so many other things I loved about this burn.  You're all
wonderful people and I'll see you at the next one!</p>

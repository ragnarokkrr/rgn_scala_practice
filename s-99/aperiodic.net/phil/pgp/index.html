<h1>PGP Info Index</h1>

<p>This section of my website is devoted to PGP.  I am a large fan of
privacy, as well as being a bit paranoid, so I like the idea of PGP and
its public key infrastructure.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, I have a PGP public key.  It's key ID
<tt>026A27F2</tt> with fingerprint <tt>D200 5BDB FC4B B24A 9248 &nbsp;9F7A
4322 2D22 026A 27F2</tt>.  It's available from all of the OpenPGP
keyservers I know of, but you can also <a href="http://aperiodic.net/phil/pgp/gpgkey.txt">grab it
here</a>, if you like.  (Use of my previous key, id <tt>D8C75CF5</tt>, is
now deprecated.)</p>

<p>I've written a <a href="tutorial.html">tutorial</a> that covers the
basics of using GPG (the <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GNU Privacy
Guard</a>) to create, sign, and use a PGP key.  I'm not sure why, but I've
kept around the <a href="http://aperiodic.net/phil/pgp/irc.log">IRC log</a> (also <a
href="irc.log.html">HTMLified</a>) that led to the tutorial in the first
place.</p>

<p>A friend of mine (<a href="http://www.pobox.com/~mgurski00001/">Mike
Gurski</a>) wrote a simple script to send and receive keys to and from
all of the keyservers at once.  I made a few changes and the result is <a
href="recv-keys.html"><code>recv-keys</code></a>.</p>

<p>I've put up a page with my <a href="policy.html">keysigning policy</a>, 
so people can see what criteria I use for signatures.</p>

<p>Finally, I have a set of tools I use to maintain a graph of my web of
trust.  <tt><a href="gpgtree_funcs">gpgtree_funcs</a></tt> is a set of
shell functions to run everything.  (They work in zsh and should also
work in any Bourne-shell-compatible shell.)  Basically, they work by
maintaining a separate keyring solely for the web of trust.  In order for
them to work, you'll need gpg, perl, the previously-mentioned recv-keys
script, <a href="http://www.chaosreigns.com/code/sig2dot/">sig2dot.pl</a>,
and dot and neato from
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/">graphviz</a>.
Note that, worldwide, there is one "strong set" of keys that all have
connected signature paths.  This set is (at last count) roughly 10000 keys
in size.  If your key is a member of this set, these scripts will not work
for you.  As they have ceased working for me.  I'm trying to figure out a
better approach.</p>

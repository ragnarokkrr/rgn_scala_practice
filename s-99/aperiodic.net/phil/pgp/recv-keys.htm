<h1>recv-keys</h1>

<p>recv-keys is a simple shell script written by Mike Gurski to send and
receive PGP keys to (and from) all of the OpenPGP keyservers.  This
bypasses the problem that not all of the servers synchronize to each
other.</p>

<p>You will need the <code>host</code> program (which probably came with
your OS distribution) and <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GPG</a>.  You'll
also need a Unix computer--this won't work under Windows.</p>

<p>To use it, download <a href="recv-keys(1).htm">recv-keys</a> and put it in a
directory in your $PATH.  In that directory, make a hard link from it to
send-keys (i.e. run '<code>ln recv-keys send-keys</code>').  Then, run
whichever is appropriate with a list of key IDs.  To send my public key to
the keyservers, I'd run '<code>send-keys D8C75CF5</code>'.</p>

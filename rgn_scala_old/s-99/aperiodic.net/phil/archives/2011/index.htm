<p>A question that perturbed me when I lived in Owings Mills was why there
were so many roads named "Dolfield".  There are three different Dolfield
Roads, one South Dolfield Road, and three Dolfield Boulevards.  I finally
got around to researching the question, and now I share the answer (to the
degreee that I have one) with everyone.</p>

<p>This is a map of Dolfield Road, past and present:</p>

<p>The thick, dark blue line is where Dolfield Road once ran.  At one point,
it connected Painters Mill Road and Deer Park Road.</p>

<p>The thinner, light blue line shows where Dolfield Road, in all its
parts, runs today.  When Interstate 795 was built, Dolfield Road was cut
in two, as happened to many roads during the construation of the
Interstate system.  At the same time, part of the eastern portion of
Dolfield Road was diverted to make room for the ramps from Owings Mills
Boulevard to Interstate 795.  The section of Dolfield Road south of Owings
Mills Boulevard was renamed South Dolfield Road, for reasons I cannot
find.</p>

<p>At some point--I cannot tell when, exactly--the chunk of Dolfield Road
that extends from present-day Red Run Boulevard to Pleasant Hill Road was
closed, though I was unable to find out why.  The small section between
Red Run Boulevard and Interstate 795 now serves as an access road to a SHA
facility, and the rest of the closed section has been turned into a
hiking/biking trail (colored in light green on the map).  Finally, the
section of Dolfield Road just west of Pleasant Hill Road was realigned
when Dolfield Boulevard was built.</p>

<p>Here's a map of Dolfield Boulevard:</p>

<p>At some point in the past, the county planned to build a road named
Dolfield Boulevard that would connect Owings Mills New Town with the
eastern area of Reisterstown, both areas that were slated for new
development.  The road was planned to have two lanes in each direction
with a raised median dividing the road.  The dark purple line on the above
map shows where it was to have gone, as far as I can tell.  I'm not sure
whether the original plans included anything further north, though it
might have made sense to connect it to Owings Mills Boulevard.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the county, a number of people living in the proposed
path of the new road put up sufficient objections that the project
stalled.  Portions along Reisterstown Road and Academy Avenue were built
and, in both cases, partly divided and partly not--the light purple
lines are the divided sections and the pink lines are the undivided
sections.  Furthermore, the southern end of Dolfield Boulevard was built
without incident as part of the development of Owings Mills New Town,
though part of Pleasant Hill Road was rechristened Dolfield Boulevard but
left undivided.</p>

<p>From what I can tell, the county never entirely abandoned its plans for
Dolfield Boulevard, but they seems to be shelved indefinitely.  Separately
from those plans, they are currently considering adding an interchange
between Dolfield Boulevard and Interstate 795 (which would have been
really convenient for me if it had been in place when I lived there).</p>

<p>So there are three sections of Dolfield Road (and a South Dolfield Road)
because Interstate 795 and other factors caused a former road to be split
into pieces, and there are three sections of Dolfield Boulevard because
that's as far as the county has gotten on the plans for a new road.  This
ends today's episode of "I'm a geek and will research anything that
catches my fancy".</p>

    <a href="../Geekery/knife-meme.htm" title="permalink for Knife Meme" rel="bookmark">#</a>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This is <a href="https://vees.net/blog/68">a thing</a>, apparently: "Take knife from pocket, post
pic on the internet."</p>

<p><a style="float: right; clear: both" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/phil_g/6169449074/" title="Myerchin Lightknife by phil_g, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6172/6169449074_f1b6778427_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Myerchin Lightknife"></a>
My main knife, and the one that best matches the intent of the
meme, I think, is a <a href="http://www.myerchin.com/">Myerchin</a> Lightknife L377P, which they
apparently don't sell anymore.  It's a very nice, light, compact knife,
with a multipurpose half-straight half-serrated blade; a marlinspike,
which is useful for knot- and ropework; and a small red LED, which is nice
for seeing things without ruining your night vision.  I use the
marlinspike a lot less these days, because I don't do as much decorative
knotwork, but it's still occasionally useful.</p>

<p>The knife was a Christmas gift from my dad and stepmother a number of
years ago.  (Possibly 2004 or so.)  I'd been thinking about replacing my
at-the-time pocket knife, something from Spyderco, with a lighter, more
compact knife, when I read
<a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/000209.php">a Cool Tools review of the Myerchin L377P</a>.  It sounded
like it would do everything I wanted and more, so I made a Christmas
request and then got what I asked for.</p>

<p><a style="float: right; clear: both" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/phil_g/6169455480/" title="Brookstone Credit Card Multi-tool by phil_g, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6151/6169455480_345419841f_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Brookstone Credit Card Multi-tool"></a>
The Myerchin isn't the only knife that meets the letter of the meme's
wording, though.  I also have a credit-card-shaped multitool from
Brookstone in my wallet.  I use it mostly for its tweezers, but its pen,
needle, scissors, and knife blade are also occasionally useful.</p>

<p><a style="float: right; clear: both" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/phil_g/6168929255/" title="Victorinox CyberTool by phil_g, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6167/6168929255_7890927dc5_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Victorinox CyberTool"></a>
A knife I also usually have on me is my
<a href="http://www.swissarmy.com/MultiTools/Pages/Product.aspx?category=doityourself&amp;product=53919&amp;">Victorinox Swiss Army CyberTool</a>.  Technically, it lives in my
laptop bag, not my pocket, but I usually have the bag with me.  It's very
useful for dealing with all sorts of small-scale hardware, because it's
got the screwdriver with interchangeable phillips, flat, and torx bits,
plus the small pliers (which also include a wire cutter).</p>

<p>This was a birthday gift from my parents back in 2000 or so.  It replaced
my previous everyday knife, a
<a href="http://www.sakwiki.com/tiki-index.php?page=Automobile+Special">Swiss Army Automobile Special</a>, which had also been a
birthday gift from my parents.  Victorinox had just come out with the
CyberTool and I'd been working for a couple of years in a hardware and
software tech support position, so I let my parents know I was really
interested in the new knife.  More than ten years later, it's still
serving me well.</p>

<p><a style="float: right; clear: both" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/phil_g/6169486394/" title="CRKT Rollock by phil_g, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6156/6169486394_cedd113afd_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="CRKT Rollock"></a>
The last knife that I usually have on me (also in my laptop bag) is a
<a href="http://www.crkt.com/">Columbia River Knife &amp; Tool</a> Rollock, which doesn't appear to be
for sale anymore.  It's got an interesting opening mechanism; instead of
unfolding, the blade flips up a little and slides out of the body, locking
into place at its fullest extent.  It's mostly in my laptop bag because
it's very slim, so it doesn't take up much extra room and it's handy if
I've forgotten my Myerchin somewhere.  Because it's got a completely
straight blade, it's less of a pain to sharpen than the Myerchin, so it's
usually the sharpest knife I have on me, which sometimes means I use it
instead of the Myerchin even if I have both with me.</p>

<p>This one was a gift from my youngest sister at her wedding as thanks for
being a groomsman and playing trumpet in the wedding.</p>

<p>Just today I found about <a href="https://code.google.com/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.html#routes_txt___Field_Definitions">GTFS</a>, a standardized data format from Google
for describing public transit schedules.  I subsequently discovered that
<a href="http://mta.maryland.gov/about/publicgtfsdata.cfm">the MTA has a GTFS feed</a>.</p>

<p>Back when I didn't have a car, I used the MTA daily and had a set of
scripts to extract their schedule data from the website and import it into
<a href="http://trainsched.sourceforge.net/">trainsched</a> on my Palm Pilot.  I asked them for more structured data at
one point but was rebuffed, so I stuck with my scripts that had to be
updated every time they changed their schedule pages.</p>

<p>I don't have a Palm Pilot any more (and trainsched doesn't even run on the
PalmOS emulator on my WebOS phone), but I thought it would be nice to
update my old scripts to use the new GTFS feeds.  This should even work
with other GTFS feeds; there's nothing really MTA-specific going on.</p>

<p>The updated scripts are here: <a href="../../MTA/index.htm">GTFS to trainsched converter</a>.</p>

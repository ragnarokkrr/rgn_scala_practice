<p><a href="http://isbn.nu/0671502239" class="booktitle">E Pluribus Unicorn</a> is a collection of short
stories by Theodore Sturgeon.  All of the stories were written between
1947 and 1953, though they don't seem very dated, aside from occasional
archaic-sounding language usage.</p>

<p>The stories are mostly fantasy, though some could be considered almost
horror; many are certainly unsettling, most notably <em>The Professor's
Teddy-Bear</em>, with <em>Bianca's Hands</em> (and perhaps <em>A Way of Thinking</em>) a
close second.  <em>Die, Maestro, Die!</em> reminded me of Edgar Allan Poe, in
structure, if not in style.  There's an element of melancholy in several
of the stories, including <em>The SIlken-Swift</em>, <em>Scars</em> (which has no
elements on fantasy, but is simply a good story), and especially <em>A Saucer
of Loneliness</em>.</p>

<p>Overall, I enjoyed the collection; I hadn't read much by Sturgeon before,
and I quite like his writing.</p>

<p>It's past five in the morning. I've been up reading for almost the last
four hours because I wanted to finish the book. It's good. The pace is
much slower than I remember previous Honor Harrington books being, but
things do move along.</p>

<p>Reading all of the Honor anthologies before this book is highly
recommended.</p>

</div>

<p>I occasionally venture beyond my fiction readings into the realm of
non-fiction, and I'm pretty sure it counts even if the book is itself
about reading.  I saw <a href="http://isbn.nu/0312421842" class="booktitle">The Child That Books
Built</a> mentioned in
<a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/2003_12_14_archive.asp#107177340140443514">a
post on Neil Gaiman's blog</a> and it sounded interesting enough, so I
bought it the next time I was in a bookstore.</p>

<p>I found the book to be a rather mixed bag.  There were parts that I, like
Gaiman, found eerily similar to my own experiences--the way reading can
blot out all that transpires in the surrounding world, the discovery of
SF, reading <i>The Hobbit</i>, reading the Narnia books.  (Though in my
case, the Narnia series were the first "real" books I read with <i>The
Hobbit</i> following shortly thereafter.)  There were other parts that
didn't necessarily resonate with my experiences but which I nevertheless
found interesting--the discussion of lingual development in children, for
instance.  Some things were just there as autobiographical but didn't have
echoes in my life--much of Spufford's childhood reading differed from
mine, being separated by both distance and time, while there were books
that interested him but not me, such as the <i>Little House on the
Prairie</i> series.  Possibly related to those were the parts where I felt
that the book rambled without any clear purpose or result--the discussion
of the primeval forest, or the exploration of small-town America.</p>

<p>Overall, I found it interesting but not really compelling.  Yet another
book tucked into the category of, "Huh?  Oh, yeah, I've read that."</p>

</div>

<p>While <a href="http://isbn.nu/0345443020" class="booktitle">Perdido Street Station</a> certainly falls
under the broad-reaching umbrella of "speculative fiction", it's hard to
pin it further than that.  Like the city of New Crobuzon and many of its
inhabitants, the book is a blend of several things; there are fantasy
aspects and steampunk aspects and horror aspects and probably half a dozen
other sub-sub-genres scattered throughout.</p>

<p>There are many good things about the book, but the most immediately
obvious is Mi&#233;ville's writing style.  When he's being descriptive,
his prose drips adjectives, each chosen for just the right shading of
connotations.  As I read, I could almost feel the sludge-filled river or
the miasma of smoke above the industrial sector.  And after I stopped
reading, my mind would race along thought passageways, seeking to
maintain the same dense, rapid flow of words to which it had become
accustomed.  Many scenes left me breathless with their coiled tension, the
languor of subsequent events providing some relief.</p>

<p>The world in which New Crobuzon exists is well thought-out and very
detailed.  It's obvious that Mi&#233;ville has put significant effort into
fleshing things out.  All of the parts hold together, which is important,
because part of the enjoyment derives from exploring this whole other
world, with cactus-people and insect-headed women and demons and
causal-spinning spiders and well, you get the idea.  Many of the details
presented tie back into the story eventually, but plenty of things exist
simply because they would be there in a complete world.</p>

<p>The story itself is good, as well.  There are too many branches and
joinings to describe succinctly; you'll have to read it yourself to learn
of Lin and Isaac Dan der Grimnebulin and Too Too Abstract Individual
Yagharek Not To Be Respected and everyone else.</p>

<p>In short, it's a well-written book with a beautiful, distinct writing
style.  Go read it.</p>

<p>This book forms the third in Sharon Shinn's Samaria trilogy, being
preceeded by <a href="http://isbn.nu/0441004326" class="booktitle">Archangel</a> and <a href="http://isbn.nu/0441005195" class="booktitle">Jovah's Angel</a>.  I still think <i>Archangel</i> is
the best of the set, though <a href="http://isbn.nu/0441006205" class="booktitle">The Alleluia
Files</a> is a fairly decent book.</p>

<p><i>The Alleluia Files</i> again contains many trappings of romance, though
there are two romances this time, and consequently neither is as well
developed as previous books'.  For me, the one in <i>Archangel</i> is
still my favorite, which I realized is probably because of the way Shinn
weaves music throughout the romance and the rest of the book.  It's still
a very important part of this book, but not to the same degree as in
<i>Archangel</i>.</p>

<p>I'm afraid I'll have to do the majority of my discussion of the book below
the spoiler barrier, since I don't want to spoil either this or
<i>Archangel</i> for those that have not read them.</p>

  <h3>The Diary of Anne Frank</h3>

    <a href="diary-of-anne-frank.html" title="permalink for The Diary of Anne Frank" rel="bookmark">#</a>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Sometimes, it seems that everyone except me had to read
<a href="http://isbn.nu/0330107372" class="booktitle">The Diary of Anne Frank</a> in school.  (The fact
that I probably got more out of the book because I didn't is a piece for
another day.)  While I was reading, I learned from a friend of mine that I
was reading an edited version.  Though it is not indicated anywhere in the
copy I have, it was edited by Anne's father before publication.  (This
despite the declaration "unabridged" on the title page.)  I am told Anne's
father removed much about Anne that was specifically Jewish or related to
her burgeoning sexuality.  (The former because he wanted her to be a more
religion-neutral hero, the latter presumably because he didn't want people
reading that about his daughter.)  So I suppose I'll have to read the
fuller version at some point.  Regardless, this one is quite good.</p>

<p>Anne Frank was a talented writer.  She does a good job of expressing what
her life was like during the two years of her family's hiding from the
Germans.  At times, I did feel that I was an interloper in someone else's
thoughts, especially during the time when she was exploring her feelings
for Peter, but that lends to the feel of the book.  It tells the tale of a
young girl thrust into a situation where she has little control over her
life and how she manages to live with that.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what I think of the translation.  Anne originally wrote in
Dutch, which doesn't work well for a sadly monolingual American such as
myself.  The translation is very much one for a British audience--in
addition to things like footnotes translating guilders into shillings and
pence, much of Anne's translated language usage involved very British
phrases like, "had a jolly good row with so-and-so."  For the most part
this was relatively unnoticeable, since the phrasing flowed very smoothly
through my understanding, but occasionally I was struck by the contrast
inherent in a Dutch girl being given a British voice.  I understand the
reasons for the mode of the translation, but I do wonder what exactly Anne
really wrote.  (For a real answer, I'd have to learn Dutch, and for a
<em>real</em> answer, I'd probably have to grow up in Holland.)</p>

<p>What strikes me most is Anne's generally unflagging optimism throughout
the whole book.  In one of her final entries, she waxes very
introspective, examining her thoughts and behaviors carefully.  Near the
end of that entry, she writes, "It's really a wonder that I haven't
dropped all my ideals because they seem so absurd and impossible to carry
out.  Yet, I keep them, because in spite of everything I still believe
that people are really good at heart.  I simply can't build up my hopes on
a foundation consisting of confusion, misery, and death."</p>

<p><a href="http://isbn.nu/1401200893" class="booktitle">Endless Nights</a> is another book from Neil
Gaiman in the world of The Sandman.  It contains seven stories, one for
each of the Endless.  It is ... impressive.</p>

<p>Each of the stories captures the personality of one of the Endless.
Possibly the weakest of them in that respect are Death's and Dream's, but
they're also probably the most prominent characters in the Sandman series,
so the lapse is forgivable, especially since Dream's gives some very nice
backstory for the Endless.</p>

<p>Probably my favorites from the set are Desire's and Destiny's stories.
Each is a succinct encapsulation of its respective Endless's personality,
combined with some stunning artwork.  Death's, Dream's, Delirium's, and
Destruction's are all good stories, with excellent artwork of their own.
Despair's story is probably the one most different from the others, and
while it's very well done, I can't say that I enjoyed it, largely because
it isn't really meant to be enjoyed.  I'll say simply that it is very well
executed, contains superb artwork, and I had to rest for a while after
reading it to recover.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of Sandman, buy this book.  If you're not familiar with
Sandman, a lot of the point of this will be missing.  It's probably still
worth reading for the artwork alone, but the Endless are what really drive
this book.</p>

<p>For my part, I'm very happy to place this book on my shelf beside my
other Sandman novels.</p>

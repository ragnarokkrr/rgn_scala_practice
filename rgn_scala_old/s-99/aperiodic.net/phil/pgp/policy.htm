<h1>PGP Signature Policy</h1>

<p>The <a href="http://rfc.net/rfc2440.html">OpenPGP standard</a>
specifies four types of signatures on public keys, numbered from 0x10 to
0x13.  These are listed in the <a href="http://rfc.net/rfc2440.html#s5.2.1.">
Signature Types</a> section of the standard.  (Different programs may
represent these levels differently--GnuPG displays nothing for 0x10 and
numbers 0x11 through 0x13 as 1 through 3.)</p>

<p>I have certain criteria I use for each level of certification I use on
public keys:</p>

<dt>0x10</dt>
<dd>Uncategorized.  This signature was made before GnuPG gained support
  for specifying the level of certification.  It is possible that I may
  use this for a signature that I refuse to categorize, but that has not
  yet happened.
</dd>
  
<dt>0x11</dt>
<dd>Very casual certification.  This signature was made on a key of
  someone whom I do not know personally and have only verified their
  identity via some third-party identification that I reasonably trust.
  (So far, that has been limited to state-issued driver's licenses.)  The
  email address in the uid appears to go to the named keyholder.
</dd>

<dt>0x12</dt>
<dd>Personal knowledge of the keyholder.  This signature was made on a key
  belonging to someone I have known personally for long enough that I'm
  reasonably sure of their identity.  The email address certainly goes to
  the keyholder.
</dd>

<dt>0x13</dt>
<dd>Extremely high trust in the keyholder's identity.  I have not yet used
  this level of certification on anyone else's keys.  In order for me to
  do so would require that I do extensive research on the person to verify
  their identity.  I do not anticipate ever doing this, so for the moment,
  the only keys signed with this level of certification will be my
  own.
</dd>

<p>The MTA recently announced a
<a href="http://www.mtamaryland.com/MTA_GBBI.cfm">Greater Baltimore Bus
Initiative</a>.  They are planning to restructure most of the bus routes in
the Baltimore system, in what I believe is that first major overhaul the
system has ever undergone.</p>

<p>On looking at the proposal for the first time, the initial impression I
got was one of reduction.  Four lines will be added (the 9, 28, 40, and
41) while 18 will be discontinued (the 2, 7, 10, 27, 31, 36, 61, 65, 86,
91, 98 (Hampden Neighborhood Shuttle), 102, 103, 104, 105, 150, 160, M6,
and M12).  (In most cases, each of the areas served by the discontinued
lines will be served by a different line after the reorganization.)  The
reduction has both good and bad aspects.  On the good side, it will
simplify the routes significantly.
<a href="31-route.html">As I've
written before</a>, the current routes are somewhat baroque, with lots of
branches and optional sections.  The new plan looks like it eliminates
most of those, leading to simpler and more understandable routes, at the
cost of convenience--many places will be farther from the buses than they
are now, though the limit seems to be between four and eight city blocks.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are several places where the MTA is simply
cutting service completely, largely to the north and northeast of the
city.  The 83 corridor will remain accessible, but that service will stop
at Hunt Valley Mall.  Along the rest of the north and northeast portion of
the current service area, service will stop at or barely outside the
Beltway.  The 8 will no longer go to Stella Maris; the 15 will stop short
of the Beltway, no longer going to Rutherford Business Park, Windsor
Hills, Ingleside Avenue, and Forest Park Avenue; the 19 will no longer go
to Cub Hill or Joppa Heights; the 23 will not go to Hawthorne and Wilson
Point; the M10's entire route north of Smith Road, which currently goes up
to Greenspring Station, will be removed; and the M12's service will be
dropped completely, eliminating access outside the Beltway along Stevenson
Road, Park Heights Avenue, and Greenspring Valley Road, the latter of
which renders Villa Julie College inaccessible.  I know people who use
some of those removed routes, and I have occasionally made use of some of
them myself.  Losing them makes Baltimore's public transit system much
worse.</p>

<p>I'd say that the changes proposed are more bad than good.  The "good"
parts are mostly that the bus routes have been simplified and bus
frequency increased in heavily-used areas.  The simplification is not
without its downside, though, since it leaves many people walking much
farther to get to a bus.  The bad part is that large sections of service
are simply being removed, causing serious problems for anyone who uses
those sections.</p>

<p>The MTA is holding community meetings this week and public hearings next
week to solicit feedback on the proposal.  (I have no idea what the
difference between a "community meeting" and "public hearing" is.)  The
public hearings all start at 4pm on weekdays, with the exception of the
one that starts at noon on a weekday.  Needless to say, they're not
terribly convenient for people who work.  The community meetings, at
least, all start at 6pm.</p>

<p>The Baltimore Sun has

  <h3>Light Rail Double Tracking</h3>
  <div class="title-links">

    <a href="light-rail-south-opens-north-closes.html" title="permalink for Light Rail Double Tracking" rel="bookmark">#</a>
  </div>
</div>

<p>According to
<a href="http://www.poweredemail.com/peEmail/peView.asp?msg=65&amp;id=92">a
recent announcement</a>, the southern portion of the Light Rail will open
completely on December 5th.  No more shuttles, at least in that direction.</p>

<p>On the other hand, they're closing the northern portion (everything north
of North Avenue) on January 3rd.  And the shuttle bus system they have set
up is confusing, to put it mildly.</p>

<p>From what I can tell, there will be three shuttle routes, designated 'A',
'B', and 'C'.  'A' shuttles will go to Falls Road.  'B' shuttles will go
to Timonium Fairgrounds and Warren Road.  'C' shuttles will go to
Lutherville, Timonium Fairgrounds, Gilroy Road, McCormick Road, Pepper
Road, and Hunt Valley.  No shuttles will go to Timonium Business Park,
Mount Washington, Cold Spring, or Woodberry.  Users of any of those latter
stops are expected to use buses that run nearby.  (Light Rail riders often
use the trains to avoid those buses.)  The Light-Rail-served terminus of
the shuttle routes is <em>not</em> North Avenue (as one might expect), but
the Cultural Center stop.</p>

<p>Confused yet?  There's more.  The 'C' route is a general service route
that will run roughly the same hours as the Light Rails does: 5am to
midnight on Monday through Saturday and 10am to 8pm on Sunday.  The 'A'
and 'B' routes are limited-time express routes: the 'A' will run from 6am
to 10am and 2:30pm to 6:30pm; the 'B' will run from 6am to 9:30am and
2:30pm to 6:30pm.  Both express routes will only run on weekdays.</p>

<p>They don't say what the more specific time constraints are.  (Does "to
10am" mean that the last bus will start its last run at 10:00, or that the
last bus will arrive at its final destination at 10:00?)  They don't say
how often the buses will be running.  (Probably because there's either no
set schedule or because the schedule won't be enforced at all; either
would fit the behavior of the southward-running buses this year.)</p>

<p>Neither <a href="http://www.mtamaryland.com/">the MTA's website</a> nor
<a href="http://www.mtadoubletrack.com/">the Double Track Project's
website</a> has any mention yet of these changes.</p>

<p>Bikes are a popular way to get around, and should compliment public
transportation.
<a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/bal-md.bicycle12jul12,0,6519166.story?coll=bal-pe-maryland">A
recent Baltimore Sun article</a> about
<a href="http://epistolary.org/4282.html">Critical Mass</a> has some
rather discouraging comments about bike riding in Baltimore.
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=kazoogrrl">Amy</a>
wrote <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/kazoogrrl/106504.html">a
rather scorching response</a>.</p>

<p>In other news, the Light Rail has reopened the segment between Camden
Yards and Linthicum.  The Convention Center stop (at least) still has
posted notices saying that everything south of Camden Yards is closed.  It
also still displays a schedule from before the double tracking started.</p>

  <h3>MTA Plans New Management System</h3>

<p>The MTA announced a few days ago that they would be implementing a new
system to track and report on the state of their vehicle fleet.
<a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/bal-next0209,0,4420584.story?coll=bal-local-headlines">The
Baltimore Sun has an article</a>, and
<a href="http://www.mdot.state.md.us/News/2004/February%202004/NEXT_attachment.htm">the
Department of Transportation has some details</a>.  They say they'll be
done by 2006; no indication on when they'll start putting things in.</p>

<p>It looks like this could be very nice and should address a few of my
complaints about the MTA.  The Next Train Arrival signs should nicely
handle my complaints about not being notified when things go wrong and
trains get delayed, while the Next Vehicle Arrival signs will do the same
thing for the buses, a feat that's currently pretty much impossible.</p>

<p>They tout a public announcement system that "will provide audio
announcements at Light Rail, Metro &amp; MARC passenger stations."  Of course,
they already have this, at least at Light Rail and MARC stations--the MARC
system even gets used.  Perhaps they're just indicating that they'll begin
to use the ones at Light Rail stops, too.</p>

<p>With the buses being tracked in real time, they'll be providing real-time
trip planning, which will also be a nice added feature.  This will be
available via the MTA's website; with any luck, it'll be simple enough
that I will be able to write a program to get an overview of my trips to
and from work right before I leave.</p>

<p>The Automatic Passenger Counter should be nice for redistributing routes
and schedules based on actual ridership.</p>

<p>And finally, they mention that the buses will be controlled via wireless
LAN.  I hope they've got good safeguards on those.</p>

<p>SO the new system looks good.  It's at least got the potential to make
public transit in Baltimore a little better.  Just how much of that
potential will be realized remains to be seen.</p>

<p>The Light Rail was fun this morning. Got on at the Convention Center stop as normal, then drowsed until reaching North Avenue. At that stop, we were informed by the driver that we would have to get off and take buses further north. There were two buses waiting and an MTA supervisor directing people onto them. I said I was going to Timonium and he pointed me at the first bus of the pair.</p>

<p>I was a little annoyed at this point because the service update board they'd put up were blank--this was not an announced outage. Upon reading the <a href="http://www.mtamaryland.com/enews_detail.cfm?category=Light%20Rail">Light Rail service status page</a> the MTA provides, I learned that this was unplanned. Still, they could have been more prepared, especially since they're planning to do this sort of thing regularly in the future.</p>

<p>It turned out that the bus I was on went directly to the Timonium area, skipping the more southerly Light Rail stops. This makes sense, since buses are slower than the trains. The driver, however, was unfamiliar with the area and had not been given driving directions. I had to direct her from the Lutherville stop to the Timonium Business Park and Timonium Fairgrounds stops. I only realized after going past it that she'd been told to only stop at the Lutherville, Timonium Fairgrounds, and Hunt Valley stops, so the Timonium Business Park one was a waste of time. I then gave her directions from the Timonium Fairgrounds stop to the Hunt Valley stop.</p>

<p>Neither she nor the supervisor communicated adequately to the riders what exactly was going on. It wouldn't have taken too long to say, "This bus is going to the Lutherville, Timonium, and Hunt Valley Light Rail stops," and that would have made things go a little more smoothley, I think. Several people (including me, though I was less affected) were confused by the stops the bus skipped.</p>

<p>This evening, a pickup truck ended up on the Light Rail tracks around
Northern Parkway.  To say that the MTA didn't handle it well would be an
understatement.</p>

<p>I left work at about 5:20 and arrived at the Light Rail stop a little
before 5:30.  There was already a train there, sitting with its doors
open.  I asked people what the wait was and was told there was some
accident.  I waited a while and eventually the driver announced that he
would go to the Lutherville stop.  No word on what was going on, just,
"I'm going to Lutherville."  When we got there (two stops down the line),
the driver announced that he had to stop until he was told he could go.  I
considered taking the 8 bus from there, but figured that whatever shuttle
system the MTA had set up would still be faster than the 8.  Eventually,
we got moving again, traveled to the next station, Falls Road, and the
driver said we all had to get out.  That was the extent of the
communication from the driver.  He was minimally informative and gave no
indication of what the MTA was doing to cope with the situation.</p>

<p>At the Falls Road stop, I looked around for any MTA personnel so I could
see what was going on.  There were none.  I pulled out my system map,
figured out what buses I needed to take, and set out.  On my way out I
passed an MTA supervisor's car driving in, so I went back to see what was
up.  The woman assured me that there were shuttle buses on the way; she'd
left at the same time they had, but she'd taken back roads impassable to
buses.  I was told that the buses would take us to the North Avenue Light
Rail stop, at which point we could board a train and continue south.
Replacement Light Rail drivers got out of her car, switched places with
the drivers of the trains at the stop, and she and the old drivers drove
off.</p>

<p>Roughly fifteen minutes later a bus arrived, disgorged its passengers and
then closed its doors.  When someone went to ask the driver what was going
on, they discovered that the driver had been told to take people from
North Avenue to Falls Road, but hadn't been told anything about bringing
people back.  She called her supervisor (a different person than I had
talked with), who also didn't know anything about it, but told her to
bring us down to North Avenue.  On the way back I talked with the driver a
little.  She had been given only the roughest of directions on how to get
to the Falls Road stop, and those had been given verbally; a passenger had
supplied her with the necessary details.</p>

<p>By the time we got to the North Avenue stop, the tracks appeared to have
been reopened; the first train to go by was northbound and went north past
us.  I waited about 15 minutes more before a southbound train arrived.</p>

<p>All told, I got home two hours later than normal.  Given the
circumstances, I could have understood some delay, but the MTA's
mishandling of the situation led to even worse conditions.</p>

<p>A distilled version of this tale will be filed with the MTA as a
complaint, not that I expect them to do anything about it.</p>

  <h3>The MTA's New Website</h3>

  </div>
</div>

<p>The MTA recently launched a <a href="http://www.mtamaryland.com/">new
website</a>, one with which I'm quite happy.  It addresses many of the
complaints I had about the old site, and is, in general, much more
usefully laid out.</p>

<p>The most obvious change is the new layout of the front page.  They've
replaced the old static navigation with a table showing the current status
of each area of service: bus, subway, light rail, MARC, commuter bus, and
paratransit.  For each of those, there's a color-coded button indicating
the general health of the service, followed by a brief line of text giving
an overview.  If additional detail is available, there's a link to the
full description.  (And that link is a normal one--no opening in a new
window and <em>no javascript</em>.  I'm pleased with that.)</p>

<p>Finally, the table has links down the righthand side to the schedules for
each service area.  The schedules are arranged nicely, with HTML and PDF
available for everything.</p>

<p>Also of note is the removal of the trip planner from the site, a move that
was long overdue.  They say they'll put it back up if they can get it to
work.  (The MTA used nicer wording than that, of course.)</p>

<p>I've been having intermittent problems with my car that have now stumped
two mechanics, so I'm turning to the Internet for advice.  I have a 1996
Jeep Grand Cherokee, with Selec-Track four-wheel-drive and a 6 cylinder
engine.</p>

<p>The problem I'm having is that the engine will sometimes just stall (the
motive power goes away and the engine RPMs drop to zero).  It only seems
to happen right after starting the car (so the engine hasn't warmed up
yet), and it's much more common in wet weather (rain, snow, heavy fog).
Often times, I can feel the engine losing power and can prevent a stall by
stepping on the gas pedal.  If the engine actually stalls, I have to wait
at least a minute to restart it; if I try restarting it immediately, I
hear the chug-chug-chug of the starter, but the engine won't start
running.</p>

<p>I've had a few times when the stalling seemed to hit as I was braking,
just as the automatic transmission was downshifting from second to first
gear.  I've had the car sall at times apparently unrelated to shifting,
though.</p>

<p>This morning, it was particularly bad.  I barely got out of the parking
lot at home (after several stop/wait/restart cycles) before the engine
stopped being useful--it would only run for 30-45 seconds before stalling,
and I couldn't prevent the stall.  I had the car towed to a mechanic, but
by the time they took a look at it, the engine started and ran normally.
They couldn't find anything wrong with the engine, and there were no codes
from the onboard diagnostics.</p>

<p>The coolant system has a slow leak (my regular mechanic tracked it to the
water pump, I think), but I've had that for over a year now and I doubt
it's related.  In the time since the problem first manifested, I've had a
system tune-up (including replacing the spark plug wiring, apparently a
common contributor to problems such as these), had the oil changed, had
the transmission fluid changed, and had a (presumably unrelated)
badly-leaking coolant hose replaced.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on what to look for to fix this will be gladly accepted.
I'll be cross-posting this to several social media sites; responses there
are fine, or just send an email to <a href="mailto:phil_g@pobox.com">phil_g@pobox.com</a></p>

<p><strong>Update 2010-01-02</strong>: I've gotten a number of suggestions for problem
areas that could be causing this problem.  The most-suggested item was the
fuel filter, which I haven't replaced since I got the car five years ago,
so I'm taking care of that to start with.  I'll see how well the car
behaves with a new filter.  Other suggestions have included the idle
valve, O2 sensor, or fuel pump.  If replacing the fuel filter doesn't
work, I'll check out some of the other possibilities.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>I've been contributing to <a href="http://www.kiva.org/">Kiva</a> for a number of months now, and am
sufficiently appreciative of them to want to tell others about them.  The
short version is that Kiva is a distributed, peer-to-peer microlending
non-profit with the goal of alleviating global poverty.</p>

<h4>Microlending</h4>

<p>Microfinance is the practice of providing financial services to people in
low-income parts of the world who are not generally considered
profitable-enough customers to warrant service from traditional banking
institutions.</p>

<p>Microlending (or microcredit) is a subset of microfinance that provides
loans to low-income people, typically entrepreneurs in low-income area of
the world, who do not have access to loans from traditional banking
sources.  Sometimes there simply are no banks in the area, but more
typically the entrepreneurs don't make enough money to qualify for loans,
don't have sufficient collateral, or don't have a sufficient credit
history.  Modern microlending started in the 1970s with the
Bangladesh-based Grameen Bank.</p>

<p>The advantages of microlending over traditional aid programs are in its
benefits to developing economies: it encourages growth of local
businesses, puts more money into local economies, encourages local
employment opportunities, and gives entrepreneurs a foothold to establish
their businesses and a credit record.  In some areas, it provides an
alternative to tribal moneylenders, who charge high interest rates and
respond to repayment failures with physical violence.  In short,
traditional aid addresses people's basic needs: food, shelter, clothing,
education, sustainable agriculture; while microlending works on the next
step of growing local economies.</p>

<h4>Kiva's contribution</h4>

<p>Kiva was created as the first distributed, peer-to-peer microlending
organization in the world.  It's peer-to-peer because all Kiva does is
list loan applicants on their website; it's up to the users of the website
to supply the money to fund the loans.  As the loans are repaid, those
repayments go to the people who supplied the money.  Kiva is distributed
because the funding for any given loan is made up of contributions from
many different Kiva users.  (And as the loan is repaid, each contributor
is repaid according to his or her portion of the overall loan.)</p>

<p>The actual process is a little more involved.  Kiva doesn't make loans
directly.  Instead, they partner with microfinance institutions (MFIs) in
other countries.  The MFIs accept loan applications, evaluate the
applicants, disburse loans, and collect payments.  During this process,
the MFIs tell Kiva about the loans in batches, Kiva lists the loans,
collects the contributions from Kiva users, and sends the money to the
MFIs.  When the MFIs collect money, they send the payments (again, in
batches) to Kiva, which distributes the payments to the loan contributors.
The MFIs often fund the loans before telling Kiva about them (to avoid the
delays in the funding process and get the money to the applicant quickly),
and then backfill the accounting once the loan is actually funded.  In
some cases, a loan will expire on Kiva without being fully funded; when
that happens, any contributors will have their contributions refunded, and
if the MFI already disbursed the loan, they will have to find another
source of funding for it.</p>

<h4>Loan repayment</h4>

<p>When payments are received on a loan, the money is made available to
contributors as "Kiva Credits".  If you have Kiva credits, you can apply
them to a different loan, donate them to Kiva itself, or transfer them
into a PayPal account.</p>

<h4>Defaults</h4>

<p>Because most loans are made in developing areas of the world, if someone
defaults on their loan, there is often no workable legal recourse for
requiring repayment and the people who contributed to the loan are not
repaid.  The MFIs do research on the applicants before granting loans, and
do a generally good job of selecting people who will repay their loans.
Kiva has an overall default rate of about 2%.  (For comparison, in 2004,
the federal Small Business Administration, which makes loans to small
businesses in the US, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2009/02/25/smallbusiness/smallbiz_loan_defaults_soar.smb/">had a 2.4% default rate</a>, which has
hit 11.9% with the recession.)</p>

<p>This does mean that any loan made through Kiva carries the risk of losing
the money contributed.</p>

<h4>Interest</h4>

<p>Kiva does not collect any interest on its loans.  Consequently, Kiva users
will only get back exactly what they put into the loan in the first place,
unless the loan defaults.  This means that anyone contributing to Kiva
loans over a long term can expect to lose some money to defaults.  Because
Kiva is operated as a non-profit organization with the goal of alleviating
poverty, they don't feel it is appropriate to add interest payments to the
loans they fund.</p>

<p>The MFIs that Kiva partners with do charge interest, however.  The
interest that they charge pays for their staff and administration costs.
Typically, they charge a small percentage of the loan in interest, plus a
flat fee to cover the effort necessary for any loan, regardless of its
size.  This includes things like interviewing applicants and researching
their financial history and dependability.  Because the loan amounts are
small, that fee often adds a noticeable percentage to the loan, leading to
interest rates that seem surprisingly high.  The average interest rate on
Kiva is about 35%, but I've seen rates as high as 50%.</p>

<p>The MFI interest rates are another reason that Kiva doesn't charge
interest themselves; they don't want to add any more to the borrower's
repayment load.</p>

<p>For each of its partners, Kiva shows both the average interest rate for
that MFI and the median interest rate for other MFIs in the same region.
People worried about the high rates are encouraged to check up on the MFI
before committing to a loan.</p>

<h4>Kiva's Funding</h4>

<p>Since Kiva doesn't collect interest and they apply all of a contributor's
money to the loans themselves, they rely on donations to keep running.
After you contribute to a loan, they ask for a donation and suggest an
amount equal to 15% of your loan contribution.  You have the option of
choosing a different percentage (including 0%) or specifying a particular
dollar amount.  You can also give the repayments on your loans to Kiva as
a donation, either manually (by donating your Kiva credits) or
automatically (by specifying that all repayments should be automatically
donated).</p>

<p>Kiva is a 501(c)3 nonprofit, so all donations are tax-deductible, although
loans are not.  (As mentioned above, loans are not even guaranteed to
maintain value.)</p>

<h4>Criticism</h4>

<p>I feel it would be unfair to talk about Kiva without acknowledging that
some people have criticisms of the microlending process.</p>

<p>The most common criticism about microlending in general is the high
interest rates.  Kiva does as well as it can in this area, recognizing
that MFIs need to charge enough to fund their activities, but also being
as transparent as possible about what is being charged.  Kiva also
periodically reviews their partners' claims and practices.  (They have
<a href="http://www.kiva.org/about/aboutPartner?id=53">closed relations with at least one partner</a> because of fraud--not
interest related, in this case; the partner was claiming much higher
amounts on its loans than it was actually disbursing.)</p>

<p>Conversely, some people argue that Kiva should themselves be charging
interest.  I can't find the article now, but I read a piece a while back
that argued that when microfinance funding organizations like Kiva pay
interest, contributors change from a "charity" mindset to an "investment"
mindset and end up putting more money into system.  Personally, I think
that the charity mindset is a better fit here.  If the goal is to
alleviate poverty, then helping people establish businesses with as few
impediments (including additional interest) as possible is a better
approach than one that is beholden to the best return on investments.</p>

<p>There are also claims that microlending doesn't help all that much.  There
was an article in the Boston Globe a few months ago titled "<a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/09/20/small_change_does_microlending_actually_fight_poverty?mode=PF">Small
change</a>: Billions of dollars and a Nobel Prize
later, it looks like ‘microlending’ doesn’t actually do much to fight
poverty".  Despite the inflammatory subtitle, the article is reasonably
balanced.  It refers to two unpublished papers about studies that
concluded that microlending is not as effective as many people think.  For
one thing, I'd want to wait until the papers are published; peer review is
likely to shake out any methodological problems in the studies.  But the
article points out that the studies found that microlending did make a
difference for a lot of businesses and helped them either establish
themselves or grow.  It's not a panacea--if for no other reason than that
the eligibility requirements for "who can take out a loan and be counted
on to repay it if there's little government enforcement to rely on" mean
that only a small part of the population will be considered in the first
place--but it is a step in the direction of helping establish functioning
local economies in poor regions.  The article provides a number of
pro-microfinance perspectives, most of which boil down to, "The studies
show that microlending isn't magic, but it's a useful tool--as long as you
understand that it isn't magic."</p>

<p>Kiva in particular was the target of some criticism recently when they
began offering loans to entrepreneurs in the US.  Many people felt that
people in the US are either well-served by the standard banking system or
have access to many government programs and would not get much additional
benefit from a microloan.  I tend to regard this as a place where it's
best to give people the ability to make their own decisions.  Kiva felt
that there was benefit to offering loans in the US, and those who agree
with them can now participate in those loans.  Those who disagree have no
obligation to fund US loans, and there are plenty of available loans in
poorer countries.  (There was a time when Kiva funded every loan it
offered and sometimes ran out of new loans to fund.  These days, there's
more demand, and loans do periodically expire unfunded.)</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>I think that Kiva provides an important service to developing areas of the
world, and I put a portion of my charitable giving into the site each
month.  Personally, I don't plan to take money out of it; what I put in
goes either towards funding more loans or donations to keep Kiva running.
Other people have different financial approaches, of course.</p>

<p>Kiva also isn't the only place I donate.  In addition to local giving, I
also contribute to more traditional aid organizations, because
microlending is only effective if people are already healthy, educated,
and empowered.  For giving along more traditional lines, I recommend
<a href="http://www.heifer.org/">Heifer International</a>, which mostly focuses on
sustainable agriculture in developing regions.</p>

<h4>Competition</h4>

<p>Kiva was the first peer-to-peer microlending website, but many others have
followed in its footsteps, and some of its competitors take different
approaches to microlending.  If you don't like Kiva, there might be
another organization that's a better fit for you.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.microfinancegateway.org/p/site/m/">The Microfinance Gateway</a> is a large database of
microfinance organizations, including aggregators like Kiva.  It
contains links to many more organizations than I'm going to link to
here.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.unitedprosperity.org/">United Prosperity</a> doesn't directly give
contributed money to borrowers; it uses that money as collateral for
traditional bank loans.  They feel that this approach is better at
integrating people into the traditional banking system.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rotarianmicrocredit.org/">The Rotarian Action Group for Microcredit</a> works to assist
Rotary groups with setting up their own microlending operations.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.microplace.com/">MicroPlace</a> collects interest on its microloans, so
contributors earn a return on their contributions.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.prosper.com/">Prosper</a> is a more general peer-to-peer lending broker.
Contributors can use it either as a general investment fund or a broker
for choosing individual loans to fund.  Anyone with a decent credit
score can request a loan, which is bid on by lenders.</li>
</ul>

<h4>My Kiva History</h4>

<p>If you want, you can look at <a href="http://www.kiva.org/lender/asciiphil">my lender page</a> on Kiva.  So
far, I've contributed to 11 loans:</p>

<ul>

notes that government regulations on foreign loans are murky and they
might not be able to receive the money from the borrower's payments.  I
figured it was good to support a business in Iraq, though, so I
accepted the risk.)</li>

    <a href="General/betsy-mccaughey-rebuttal.html" title="permalink for Betsy McCaughey on the Obama Stimulus Plan: A Rebuttal" rel="bookmark">#</a>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Betsy McCaughy has written an opinion piece for bloomberg.com titled <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601039&amp;sid=aLzfDxfbwhzs">Ruin
Your Health With the Obama Stimulus Plan</a>.  In it, she
characterizes the stimulus package (as passed by the House) as containing
sinister language that will allow the government to control and reduce the
quality of health care available to the American public.  I took a look at
the sections of the bill that she has issues with, and I found that her
conclusions are gross distortions at best.  More or less everything she
points to in the bill is focused on providing a healthcare information
technology infrastructure to allow doctors and hospitals easy access to
patients' complete medical information--nothing more.</p>

<p>(Since I wrote my analysis, the people at <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/">FactCheck.org</a> have
done <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/politics/doctors_orders.html" title="FactCheck.org: Doctor's Orders?">their own analysis</a>, which is more in depth than
mine.  The conclusions are similar--McCaughey is misunderstanding a lot of
the bill--although they allow that some parts of the bill don't
necessarily forbid her worst-case scenario.  (They also note that much of
what she worries about has been in place already, under a program created
by George W Bush: the bill just turns an executive order into established
law.))</p>

<p>She also makes a lot of comparisons to Tom Daschle's book
<a href="http://isbn.nu/0312383010" class="booktitle">Critical: What We Can Do About the Health-Care
Crisis</a>, drawing sinister inferences from the comparisons.  I
haven't read the book, so I can't judge how right or wrong she is about
its contents, but the contents of the actual bill are not what she says
they are.</p>

<p>To begin with, she claims that the government will be overseeing what your
doctor does and dictating treatments:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One new bureaucracy, the National Coordinator of Health Information
  Technology, will monitor treatments to make sure your doctor is doing
  what the federal government deems appropriate and cost effective. The
  goal is to reduce costs and “guide” your doctor’s decisions (442, 446).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The actual text of the bill is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>                           page 441
19      “(b) PURPOSE.--The National Coordinator shall per-
20 form the duties under subsection (c) in a manner con-
21 sistent with the development of a nationwide health infor-
22 mation technology infrastructure that allows for the elec-
23 tronic use and exchange of information and that--

                           page 442
 1            “(1) ensures that each patient's health informa-
 2      tion is secure and protected, in accordance with ap-
 3      plicable law;
 4            “(2) improves health care quality, reduces med-
 5      ical errors, reduces health disparities, and advances
 6      the delivery of patient-centered medical care;
 7            “(3) reduces health care costs resulting from
 8      inefficiency, medical errors, inappropriate care, du-
 9      plicative care, and incomplete information;
10            “(4) provides appropriate information to help
11      guide medical decisions at the time and place of
12      care;
13            “(5) ensures the inclusion of meaningful public
14      input in such development of such infrastructure;
15            “(6) improves the coordination of care and in-
16      formation among hospitals, laboratories, physician
17      offices, and other entities through an effective infra-
18      structure for the secure and authorized exchange of
19      health care information;
20            “(7) improves public health activities and facili-
21      tates the early identification and rapid response to
22      public health threats and emergencies, including bio-
23      terror events and infectious disease outbreaks;
24            “(8) facilitates health and clinical research and
25      health care quality;

                           page 443
 1            “(9) promotes prevention of chronic diseases;
 2            “(10) promotes a more effective marketplace,
 3      greater competition, greater systems analysis, in-
 4      creased consumer choice, and improved outcomes in
 5      health care services; and
 6            “(11) improves efforts to reduce health dispari-
 7      ties.
</code></pre>

<p>The whole thing is talking about making patients' medical information
available by electronic means to hospitals, doctors, and insurance
companies while maintaing the patients' privacy.  Clause (4), in
particular, refers to doctors being able to have all of the information
they need when making decisions.  It does not imply anything about the
government dictating doctors' decisions to them.</p>

<p>She goes on to talk about hospitals and doctors not being "meaningful
users" of the system, and she seems to imply that this will result in
doctors abandoning treatments that aren't government-sanctioned:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hospitals and doctors that are not “meaningful users” of the new system
  will face penalties.  “Meaningful user” isn’t defined in the
  bill. ... What penalties will deter your doctor from going beyond the
  electronically delivered protocols when your condition is atypical or
  you need an experimental treatment?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here's what the bill has to say about "meaningful users":</p>

<pre><code>                           page 511
14     “(o) INCENTIVES    FOR  ADOPTION   AND  MEANINGFUL

21           ment year (as defined in subparagraph (E)), if
22           the eligible professional is a meaningful EHR
23           user (as determined under paragraph (2)) for
24           the reporting period with respect to such year,

<p>"Meaningful EHR users" will be given financial incentives to use the
electronic system.  If a doctor or hospital is not a "meaningful EHR
user", that means only that they're not making use of the electronic
medical information infrastructure.  It has nothing to do with what
treatments they offer.  Furthermore, non-"meaningful users" don't face
penalties; they just don't have the government helping them pay for the
upfront cost of implementing the electronic system.</p>

<p>Next, she claims that the bill creates a department to prevent people from
using new medical treatments because they're more expensive:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In his book, Daschle proposed an appointed body with vast powers to make
  the “tough” decisions elected politicians won’t make.  The stimulus bill
  does that, and calls it the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative
  Effectiveness Research (190-192).  The goal, Daschle’s book explained, is
  to slow the development and use of new medications and technologies
  because they are driving up costs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, the bill:</p>

<pre><code>                           page 190
 7 SEC. 9201. FEDERAL COORDINATING COUNCIL FOR COM-
 8                 PARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH.

 2             tures for comparative effectiveness research by
 3             relevant Federal departments and agencies; and
 4                  (C) opportunities to assure optimum co-
 5             ordination of comparative effectiveness and re-
 6             lated health services research conducted or sup-
 7             ported by relevant Federal departments and
 8             agencies, with the goal of reducing duplicative
 9             efforts and encouraging coordinated and com-
10             plementary use of resources.
</code></pre>

<p>The supposedly sinister Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative
Effectiveness Research seems to be more like the Department of Homeland
Security for existing federal health care systems.  Programs like
Medicaid, veteran's benefits, and federal employee health insurance
already make estimations on the effectiveness of various treatments, just
like every private health insurance company.  The new council would
share information across the federal programs that already exist.</p>

<p>Following that, she claims that the bill would change the standards for
approved Medicare treatments, implying that fewer treatments will be
approved:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Medicare now pays for treatments deemed safe and effective. The stimulus
  bill would change that and apply a cost- effectiveness standard set by
  the Federal Council (464).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Page 464 contains references to implementing things specified under
section 3004, which describes the process for adopting and implementing
the previously-mentioned technology infrastructure.  I can find no mention
of Medicare.  It seems very much like this claim is completely fabricated.</p>

<p>Every complaint that the author raises, everything that she claims will
affect what care doctors are willing to give, seems to only concern the
healthcare information technology infrastructure that Obama has been
talking about implementing for months.  I see no places where the
government will be dictating <em>anything</em> to doctors, aside from providing
financial incentives (not punishments) to work with the new
infrastructure.  None of the author's claims about the government cutting
off healthcare seem at all founded in fact.  At best, she's consistently
misreading the text of the bill.  I think it more likely that she has
other reasons not to want the bill to pass and is distorting the reality
of the situation to steer people in the direction she wants them to go.</p>

<p>On September 27th, 2008, I got married.  As a consequence of my marriage,
I gave up my last name and took my wife's, going from Phillip Gregory to
Phillip Gold.  I've been asked about my decision a lot; this is my
explanation.</p>

<p>I feel that the prevaling societal standard--the assumption that the woman
must go through all the work to change her name and give up the identity
she's had since birth--is unfair and an example of gender inequality.
Rather than simply make that assumption, Rebecca and I discussed our names
a lot before the wedding, starting with what we each wanted out of our
married names, and working from there to a mutual decision.</p>

<p>I wanted us to both have the same name, as symbolic of our marriage.  I
also didn't want a hyphenated last name, because I feel that those are
cumbersome and unwieldy.  Rebecca also wanted to have a Jewish last name,
to honor her cultural heritage.  Finally, I was inclined to have a name
that started with "G" so my (and her) initials would stay the same.</p>

<p>Our first thought was that we would find a new name that met all of our
criteria and both change to that name.  Unfortunately, there are only
really two common Jewish surnames that start with "G": Gold and Green
(plus all the variations thereof), and we couldn't find a variation on
Green that we both liked.  We started looking at other Jewish surnames,
and I realized that I really did want to keep my initials, if only because
I have the username "phil_g" on a <em>lot</em> of sites, not least of which is
the email address I've had for over a decade now.</p>

<p>So I offered to just take Rebecca's name because that approach
accomplished everything we wanted.  She was a little hesitant, feeling
that doing so would require more of me than her, but we eventually agreed
that it seemed the best approach given our requirements.</p>

<p>Postscript: Some people suggested changing my middle name to my old last
name, as some married women do.  I opted against that approach, because my
middle name is the same as my dad's.  I would never want to give my child
the same first name as myself, but I like the subtle continuity of shared
middle names.</p>

<p>In the interests of better site availability and less Comcast
AUP-breaking, I've finally gotten around to outsourcing my website
hosting.  I'm currently at <a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/">NearlyFreeSpeech.net</a>, a webhost
committed to the twin goals of free speech and affordable web hosting.</p>

<p>How free is their speech?  Read their <a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/help/abuse">Abuse page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"A NearlyFreeSpeech.NET member site is defaming me or otherwise injuring
   me civilly."</p>
  
  <p>Please forward a copy of your legal finding from a court of competent
  jurisdiction to our contact address. If you have not yet obtained such a
  finding, a preliminary injunction or court order is also sufficient.</p>
  
  <p>If you are not able to obtain the above, you will need to work directly
  with the site operator to resolve your differences. We will have to fall
  back on our members' contractual assertion that the content they upload
  is legitimate and therefore we will not be able to get involved</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How affordable is their <a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/services/hosting.php">hosting</a>?  You pay only for the
bandwidth and storage that you actually use: $1 per gigabyte of bandwidth
and $0.01 per megabyte-month of storage.  (Plus the bandwidth cost goes
down the more you use.)</p>

<p>They support a variety of CGI scripting languages,
<a href="http://example.nfshost.com/versions.php">including</a> C, PHP, Perl, Python, and Ruby.  Oh, but also
Fortran, Tcl, <em>Lisp</em>, <em>Scheme</em>, <em>OCaml</em>, and <strong>Haskell</strong>.</p>

<p>We'll see how it goes, but I think I'll like it here.</p>

  <h3>The Two Towers: The Purist Edit</h3>

<p>They gave me back my story.</p>

<p>Ever since I read <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> in
elementary school, I've loved Middle Earth.  Like many people, I waited
with anticipation and dread for the movies by Peter Jackson.  Would he
mangle it as horribly as Bakshi?  Would they actually be good movies?  The
Fellowship of the Ring came out, and I was, by and large, pleased.
Jackson had omitted some things and rearranged some others, but the result
was good.  There was Tolkien's work, on the big screen and amazing
faithful to the text.</p>

<p>Then came The Two Towers.</p>

<p>At the time, I wrote up a page about what I thought of the movie.  Though
that writeup is now lost, it can be summed up pretty succinctly:  I didn't
like it.  Jackson took great liberties with the story, adding bits that
were never there and changing bits that were, sometimes for no apparent
reason.  It was bad in a very annoying way, because the parts that were
right were very good.  A lot of people had the same reaction as I did, and
there was much complaining.</p>

<p>At least one person did a bit more than complain.
<a href="http://forum.sharereactor.com/viewtopic.php?t=110181">The Two
Towers: The Purist Edit</a> is a reedit of the movie, in a similar spirit
to The Phantom Edit.  It removes the worst of Jackson's
additions--Aragorn's warg battle, the dwarf jokes, the Elves at Helm's
Deep, among others--and fixes some of the changes--the Ents now make the
right decision, for instance.  I can't emphasize how pleased I am with
this edit.  It's much closer to the books that I've loved for so long.</p>

<p>It's not perfect.  It's from a screener copy from one of the big awards
ceremonies, so it occasionally has "For your consideration" written across
the bottom of the screen.  Because it's essentially from the theatrical
version, the editors didn't have all the extra footage in the Extended
Edition to draw on, which was too bad in several cases.  While a lot of
the editing is pretty good, some causes feelings of abruptness and draws
attention the fact that things were excised.  In a couple of instances,
people have their lines dubbed over.  Since the lips no longer match the
words, the dubs are painfully obvious.  The editors did a good job of
removing the elves from Helms Deep.  That means that they cut out a
<em>lot</em> of footage, though, and the battle doesn't have the same
grandiose feel to it as in the original movie.  It still works, but it's
not the same.  Because of all the various cuts, the Purist Edit runs about
40 minutes shorter than the theatrical release.  And not everything was
fixed.  Fir instance, Helm's Deep is still won by Gandalf riding in with
the Rohirrim, not by the Ents and Huorns.</p>

<p>But the Purist Edit is still a vast improvement, story-wise over Jackson's
telling.  It's a lot closer to the movie I wish he'd made.  Thank you,
whoever you are, for making this edit.</p>

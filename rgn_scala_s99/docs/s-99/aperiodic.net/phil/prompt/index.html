<h1>Phil!'s ZSH Prompt</h1>

<p>In which one geek demonstrates his zsh prompt, which (he hopes) should
serve as an example of some of the more complicated aspects of zsh.</p>

<p>A while back, <a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> had an <a
href="http://slashdot.org/index.pl?section=askslashdot">Ask Slashdot</a>
question about
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/07/06/122259">shell
prompts</a>.
<a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=13108&cid=103977">I
responded</a>, posting a link to 
<a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/?op=comments;sid=2001/5/1/215312/2648;cid=42#42">an
earlier Kuro5hin post</a> I had made on the subject.  Unlike that Kuro5hin
post, the Slashdot post garnered some attention, so I decided to write up
how my prompt works.  Since then, I've expanded my prompt to take
advantage of a lot of zsh stuff, so it should also provide examples to
people curious about that sort of thing.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="normal(1).png" alt="[normal screenshot]"></td>
    <td>For the impatient, I have a screenshot and the
      <a href="http://aperiodic.net/phil/prompt/prompt.txt">prompt command</a>.  For those
      wanting more detail, I go into it below.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>My shell is zsh.  I got the initial idea for this prompt from the
"termwide" prompt in the
<a href="http://en.tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prompt-HOWTO/">Bash Prompt HOWTO</a>,
but had to modify it to work with zsh.  Since then, I've added other
features (some of which I've also seen in other termwide-based prompts)
and taken more advantage of zsh's facilities.  This prompt is now fairly
zsh-specific.</p>

<p>Let's start at the beginning.</p>

<pre>
function precmd {
</pre>

<p>There are a number of prompt variables I want to be set before each
prompt, so I change them in the special zsh function named precmd.
This is run before the prompt is displayed.</p>

<pre>
    local TERMWIDTH
    (( TERMWIDTH = ${COLUMNS} - 1 ))
</pre>

<p><code>local</code> tells zsh that the given variable should be scoped
to the current function.  I don't really like cluttering namespaces.</p>

<p>The <code>(( ... ))</code> construct tells zsh to carry out
mathematical operations.  I set the terminal width to one less that
the actual width because zsh's right-hand prompt leaves one character
to its right and I want things to line up.</p>

 <pre>
    ###
    # Truncate the path if it's too long.

    PR_FILLBAR=""
    PR_PWDLEN=""

    local promptsize=${#${(%):---(%n@%m:%l)---()--}}
    local pwdsize=${#${(%):-%~}}

    if [[ "$promptsize + $pwdsize" -gt $TERMWIDTH ]]; then
	((PR_PWDLEN=$TERMWIDTH - $promptsize))
    else
	PR_FILLBAR="\${(l.(($TERMWIDTH - ($promptsize + $pwdsize)))..${PR_HBAR}.)}"
    fi
</pre>

<p>This little section is the one that does the width adjusting.
The variables that determine string length are ... interesting.  Working
from the inside out:
<ul>
  <li><code>${[varname]:-[string]}</code> returns the value of
  ${[varname]} normally, but uses [string] instead if ${[varname]} doesn't
  exist.  <code>${:-[string]}</code> is a quick way to do variable-related
  things to fixed strings.</li>
  <li><code>${([flags])[varname]}</code> uses the flags to alter how the
  value of the variable is handled.  The percent sign causes prompt
  expansion to be done on the variable.</li>
  <li>So <code>${(%):-%~}</code> does prompt expansion on the literal
  string "%~".  (To get just this effect, <code>print -p "%~"</code> would
  work, too.)</li>
  <li><code>${#[varname]}</code> gives the length of the value of the
  variable.  zsh appears to handle the pound sign before applying the
  (%) flag, so I had to nest the (%) flag in order to get things to
  happen in the right order.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>If adding the current directory would make the prompt wider than the
terminal, I just set $PR_PWDLEN to the length it should be and let zsh
truncate it.  The actual prompt contains the string
<code>%$PW_PWDLEN&lt;...&lt;%~%&lt;&lt;</code>.  When zsh encounters a
prompt escape of the form <code>%[num]&lt;[str]&lt;</code>, it will
truncate the next part of the prompt until  the next <code>%&lt;&lt;</code>
or the end of the prompt, whichever comes first.  If truncation is
necessary, zsh will remove the beginning of the string to be truncated and
add the [str] supplied so that the entire resulting string will be [num]
characters long.</p>

<p>(Note that there's also the <code>%[num]&gt;[str]&gt;</code> sequence,
which does the truncation at the end of the string.)</p>

<p>If the combination of invariant prompt and current directory is not
wide enough to fill the terminal (this is usually the case), I use another
variable flag--one a bit more complicated.  The general form of the
left-hand padding flag is <code>${(l.[len]..[pad1]..[pad2].)[varname]}</code>.
This pads or truncates ${[varname]} so that the result is exactly [len]
characters long.  If padding is needed, the shell will use [pad2] once,
then as many iterations of [pad1] as are needed.  If you don't need
[pad2], it can be omitted, as can [varname].  I omit both, so the effect
is that [pad1] is repeated to a length of [len].  The quoting is done so I
can put variables inside the flag statement.</p>

    # Get APM info.

    if which ibam > /dev/null; then
	PR_APM_RESULT=`ibam --percentbattery`
    elif which apm > /dev/null; then
	PR_APM_RESULT=`apm`
    fi
</pre>

<p>If apm or <a href="http://ibam.sourceforge.net/">ibam</a> is present,
I'll need its output.  I could do this in the prompt itself, but calling
programs from within the prompt clobbers the value of $? (return code of
the last command run), so I call all external programs in precmd(), where
they can't do any damage.</p>

<pre>
}
</pre>

<p>And that's the end of my precmd() function.  Next is preexec(), which
is only somewhat related to my prompt, but it's here anyway.  preexec() is
run after you press enter on your command but before the command is
run.</p>

<pre>
setopt extended_glob
preexec () {
    if [[ "$TERM" == "screen" ]]; then
	local CMD=${1[(wr)^(*=*|sudo|-*)]}
	echo -ne "\ek$CMD\e\\"
    fi
}
</pre>

<p>I use <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">screen</a> for a
lot of things.  My preexec() sets the screen window title, if I'm running
in a screen.  I have fun with variable expansion to get what I want in the
title, which is the name of the program I'm currently running:</p>

<p>Subscripts for arrays can have flags that affect their behavior, just
like variables can.  The '(w)' flag causes a regular variable to be
treated as an array, with each element of the array being a
whitespace-separated word of the variable's value.  The '(r)' flag changes
the way the index works.  It returns the first element of the array that
matches the pattern supplied as the index.  In the pattern (which uses
extended globbing), '^' negates it, so I get the first element that
doesn't match.  It skips variable assignment, 'sudo', and program
options.</p>

<p>The -e option to echo isn't strictly necessary in zsh, but I use it out
of habit.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="screen(1).png" alt="[screenshot attached to screen session]"></td>
    <td>I've attached to a running screen session, which has a window list
      in the caption.  You can see that the current window, 8, is at a
      prompt, window 9 is running xemacs, and 7 is showing something with
      less.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<pre>
setprompt () {
</pre>

<p>The stuff that only needs to be set once is set in a separate function,
which I've decided to call setprompt().</p>

<pre>
    ###
    # Need this so the prompt will work.

    setopt prompt_subst
</pre>

<p>prompt_subst is not set by default.  It allows variable substitution to
take place in the prompt, so I can just change the contents of certain
variables without recreating the prompt every time.</p>

<pre>
    ###
    # See if we can use colors.

    autoload colors zsh/terminfo
    if [[ "$terminfo[colors]" -ge 8 ]]; then
	colors
    fi
    for color in RED GREEN YELLOW BLUE MAGENTA CYAN WHITE; do
        eval PR_$color='%{$terminfo[bold]$fg[${(L)color}]%}'
        eval PR_LIGHT_$color='%{$fg[${(L)color}]%}'
        (( count = $count + 1 ))
    done
    PR_NO_COLOUR="%{$terminfo[sgr0]%}"
</pre>

<p>This section determines whether or not to use color in the prompt.  I
use terminfo codes to be as portable as possible across different terminal
types.  And the zsh termcap module provides an associative array for all
of the terminfo entries for the current terminal. 'sgr0' removes all
attributes (bold, underline, etc.) from the text.  'bold' turns on bold
text.  'colors' lists the number of colors the current terminal
supports.</p>

<p>The colors module provides a function called <code>colors</code>, which
creates associative arrays $fg and $bg, which contain the
terminal-appropriate ANSI escape codes for setting the forground and
background colors, respectively.  Since the arrays are indexed by the
lowercase versions of the color names, I use the (L) flag in the parameter
expansion for $color to lower-case the value of that variable.  I've
noticed that <code>colors</code> seems to always populate the arrays
regardless of the color support of the terminal, which is why I have
the test for the number of supported colors.  I fear it may only do
ANSI colors as well, but I have yet to use zsh on a terminal that
didn't use ANSI escapes for setting the colors.</p>

<p>The escape codes are surrounded by <code>%{</code> and <code>%}</code>.
These are zsh prompt escapes that tell the shell to disregard the
contained characters when determining the length of the prompt.  This
allows zsh to properly position the cursor.</p>

    # See if we can use extended characters to look nicer.

    typeset -A altchar
    set -A altchar ${(s..)terminfo[acsc]}
    PR_SET_CHARSET="%{$terminfo[enacs]%}"
    PR_SHIFT_IN="%{$terminfo[smacs]%}"
    PR_SHIFT_OUT="%{$terminfo[rmacs]%}"
    PR_HBAR=${altchar[q]:--}
    PR_ULCORNER=${altchar[l]:--}
    PR_LLCORNER=${altchar[m]:--}
    PR_LRCORNER=${altchar[j]:--}
    PR_URCORNER=${altchar[k]:--}
</pre>

<p>Some terminals use fonts that have extended character support.  If they
do, there should be terminfo entries to: a) enable use of the line-drawing
character set (enacs), b) enter (smacs) and leave (rmacs) the alternate
character set, and c) describe the mappings of line drawing characters
(acsc).  The last needs some additional explanation.  The VT100 used the
alternate character set with certain lowercase characters to make
line-drawing characters.  For instance, "q" was a horizontal line.  The
acsc terminfo string is a series of character pairs, with the first in the
pair being the vt100 character and the second being the character to get
the same result in the current terminal.</p>

<p>A zsh associative array is a natural way to get at the appropriate line
drawing characters.  Associative arrays must be declared before use, so
that's what the <code>typeset -A</code> does.  (<code>-A</code> is for
defining an associative array.)  <code>set -A [arrayname]</code> assigns
values to the array, with keys and value alternating.  (key, value, key,
value, etc.)  This is exactly how the entries in terminfo are arranged,
but we need spaces between the entries.  The <code>(s.[pattern].)</code>
flag causes a variable to be split on every occurence of [pattern].  In my
case, there is no pattern, so it matches everywhere, splitting between
every character.</p>

<p><code>${[varname]:-[string]}</code> returns, this time with an actual
[varname].  So if the terminal doesn't support line drawing characters,
the prompt will fall back to simple dashes.</p>

    # Decide if we need to set titlebar text.

    case $TERM in
	xterm*)
	    PR_TITLEBAR=$'%{\e]0;%(!.-=*[ROOT]*=- | .)%n@%m:%~ | ${COLUMNS}x${LINES} | %y\a%}'
    ;;
	screen)
	    PR_TITLEBAR=$'%{\e_screen \005 (\005t) | %(!.-=[ROOT]=- | .)%n@%m:%~ | ${COLUMNS}x${LINES} | %y\e\\%}'
    ;;
	*)
	    PR_TITLEBAR=''
    ;;
    esac
</pre>

<p>There are several things going on here. Most generally, I'm setting
the titlebar text in terminals that support it.  xterm and xterm-alike
terminal emulators support a particular escape sequence to set their
titlebar contents.  screen uses a different escape sequence to set its
hardstatus line.  (And I have my .screenrc set up to display the
hardstatus in xterm's title bar--details to be linked.)</p>

<p>I'm also using a special zsh prompt escape.
<code>%([char].[true str].[false str])</code> is a conditional expression.
If [chr] is an exclamation point, zsh will use [true str] if the current
uid is that of root and [false str] otherwise.  Since I want to be root as
little as possible, I want zsh to yell at me a lot to remind me if I
am.</p>

<p>Finally, the whole string is inside <code>$'...'</code> delimiters.
This causes the string to be parsed like <code>echo -e</code> would do it
(so I can put in "\e" instead of literal escape characters).  No other
expansion is done, which is also what I want--$COLUMNS and $LINES should
only be processed when the prompt is displayed, to deal with changing
window sizes.</p>

      screen information is also present in the titlebar.  (There's also
      my screen caption at the bottom, but that's unrelated to my shell
      prompt.)</td>

    # Decide whether to set a screen title
    if [[ "$TERM" == "screen" ]]; then
	PR_STITLE=$'%{\ekzsh\e\\%}'
    else
	PR_STITLE=''
    fi
</pre>

<p>This is the compliment to my preexec() function.  It sets the screen
title to "zsh" when sitting at a command prompt.</p>

<pre>
    ###
    # APM detection

    if which ibam > /dev/null; then
	PR_APM='$PR_RED${${PR_APM_RESULT[(f)1]}[(w)-2]}%%(${${PR_APM_RESULT[(f)3]}[(w)-1]})$PR_LIGHT_BLUE:'
    elif which apm > /dev/null; then
	PR_APM='$PR_RED${PR_APM_RESULT[(w)5,(w)6]/\% /%%}$PR_LIGHT_BLUE:'
    else
	PR_APM=''
    fi
</pre>

<p>This is for laptops or other computers with batteries.  I assume that
if apm or ibam is installed, it's meant to be used.  These will result in
the battery percentage and time left (either to charge or discharge) being
displayed in the prompt.</p>

<p>With ibam, that information is on two separate lines.  The percentage
is on the first line, so I use <code>${PR_APM_RESULT[(f)1]}</code> to get
just that line.  The (f) flag causes the variable to be treated as an
array, with each line being a separate element.  Then
<code>${...[(w)-2]}</code> returns the second-to-last word on that line.
Similar indices retrieve the last word on the third line.</p>

<p>apm is a bit simpler.  Everything is on a single line, so we just grab
the fifth and sixth words on that line.  When two indices are separated by
a comma, the result is the range of elements between those two, inclusive.
This just happens to be a two element range.  Then substitution is
performed to remove the space between them and to double the percent sign,
so that prompt expansion witll leave a single, literal percent sign.
<code>${[varname]/[pattern]/[replacement]}</code> replaces the first
occurrence of [pattern] with [replacement].
<code>${[varname]/[pattern]//[replacement]}</code> replaces every
occurrence.</p>

<table>

    <td>Prompt on my laptop, showing 50% battery and just over two hours

$PR_NO_COLOUR '
</pre>

<p>Here's where everything is finally assembled.  There are a few things
in the prompt itself that I haven't yet explained completely:</p>

<p>I'm using the (e) flag on many variables to cause them to undergo
variable substitution.  (That way, things like $COLUMNS and $LINES are
updated automatically.)</p>

<p>The <code>%([char].[true str].[false str])</code> setup returns in
several places.  root gets a slightly more obvious prompt that a normal
user, as you can see in the previous screenshot.  Also, using a question
mark as the [char] allows me to display the exit code of the previous
command.  (The true string would be displayed if the exit code was zero,
but I have left that string blank.)</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="error(1).png"  alt="[screenshot showing a return code]"></td>
    <td>I ran <code>perl -e 'exit 42'</code>.  It dutifully returned 42,
      which was then shown in the prompt.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The <code>%D{...}</code> construct results in a date string formatted
by the contents.  The current hour and minute go on the left side.</p>

<pre>
    RPROMPT=' $PR_CYAN$PR_SHIFT_IN$PR_HBAR$PR_BLUE$PR_HBAR$PR_SHIFT_OUT\
($PR_YELLOW%D{%a,%b%d}$PR_BLUE)$PR_SHIFT_IN$PR_HBAR$PR_CYAN$PR_LRCORNER$PR_SHIFT_OUT$PR_NO_COLOUR'
</pre>

<p>zsh supports a right-hand prompt, too.  I started using it just because
it was there, but I've come to like it.  Putting stuff on the right frees
up space on the left, and the right-hand prompt simply disappears if the
command line grows past it.  Thus, I put information that would be useful
but that I don't need all that often on the right.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="right(1).png" alt="[screenshot with right prompt removed]"></td>
    <td>The right-hand prompt has been removed to make room for the
      command line.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<pre>
    PS2='$PR_CYAN$PR_SHIFT_IN$PR_HBAR$PR_SHIFT_OUT\
$PR_BLUE$PR_SHIFT_IN$PR_HBAR$PR_SHIFT_OUT(\
$PR_LIGHT_GREEN%_$PR_BLUE)$PR_SHIFT_IN$PR_HBAR$PR_SHIFT_OUT\
$PR_CYAN$PR_SHIFT_IN$PR_HBAR$PR_SHIFT_OUT$PR_NO_COLOUR '
</pre>

<p>PS2 is the continuation prompt.  I define it mostly so it will match
the main one in color.  In it, I use the <code>%_</code> prompt escape,
which shows the reason the continuation prompt is being displayed.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="continue(1).png" alt="[screenshot showing continuation prompt]"></td>
    <td>The continuation prompt, in addition to the main one.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>There are two other prompts as well (PS2 and PS3), but I don't bother
to set them because I use them rarely, it at all.</p>

<pre>
}

showprompt
</pre>

<p>And that's the end of the prompt-creating function.  Once it's defined,
I call it to actually do the setup.</p>

<p>And that's it.  My setup's rather complicated, but it allows me to use
the same configuration on every computer I use, leaving it up to the shell
to figure out what to do with itself.  I have put a bit of work into
putting this thing together, but I have to interact with the command line
every day, so I think it's worth it.</p>
